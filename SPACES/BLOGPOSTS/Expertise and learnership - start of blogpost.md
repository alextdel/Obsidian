# The start of a blogpost - expertise and learnership

### Note:

This is an unfinished comment that I started writing to James Anderson. Maybe it can form part of a blogpost.

*It seems to me that we don't do things because they are hard, we do things to achieve something of merit. The item of merit may be primary such as exceeding a specific challenge (where the drive is often ego/self-esteem) or secondary, such as when the merit gained (skills, knowledge, acceptance) is a stage on the way to the actual perceived goal. 
If we simplify any given approach to learning or developing skill, I would say the key prospect is to make something hard into something easy. This can be seen in the pursuit of routine expertise where gaining the procedural skill starts hard, becomes easy and then can either facilitate the next hard step in development toward the item of merit (which in turn becomes tacit) or give back energy, time and effort for other unrelated pursuits. 
I go back to your presentation on how people are wowed by experts, virtuoso *
