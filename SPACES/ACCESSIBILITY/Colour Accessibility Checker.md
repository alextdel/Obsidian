### Note:
The example here is from  a check of Tiddalik colours. The tool gives an accessibility ratings against black and white text of various sizes.
WCAG AA is essential, WCAG AAA is desirable - but check client requirements.

[Colour Accessibility Tool](https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=1&view.right=0&primary.color=045958&secondary.color=95c83d)

Other tools - https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/ - gives WCAG rating for foreground (text) and background colour combinations.

**NB** - Browser based and PAC Accessibility Checker tools may not be able to tell if your graphics are actually carrying transparency. If this is the case you may be able to judge a pass of the WCAG standard even though the tool indicates a fail.
