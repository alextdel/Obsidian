### Setting up for Accessibility
Here are the best settings, properties, and document settings for Adobe InDesign when creating accessible PDFs using the software:

**Document Properties**

* **Document Language:** Set the document language to the language of the content. This will ensure that screen readers and other assistive technology can properly read the document. Old article, CS2, see [here](https://liamdempsey.com/changing-default-language-for-text-boxes-in-indesign/)

* **Title:** Give the document a clear and concise title. This will help screen readers identify the document and will also be displayed in the document window's title bar.

* **Author:** Include the author's name or contact information. This will help users contact the author if they have questions about the document.

* **Keywords:** Add keywords that describe the content of the document. This will help users find the document when they are searching for information.

**Reading Order**

* **Use Paragraph Styles:** Define paragraph styles for headings, subheadings, body text, and other elements in the document. This will help screen readers understand the document's structure and reading order.

* **Use Lists:** Use bullet lists and numbered lists to organize content that is naturally organized as a list. Screen readers can identify and announce lists, which can help users understand the content.

* **Use Tables:** Use tables to present tabular data. Screen readers can identify and parse tables, which can help users understand the data.

**Graphics**

* **Provide Alternative Text (Alt Text):** Provide alt text for all images and other non-text elements in the document. Alt text is a textual description of an image that is read by screen readers to users who are visually impaired.

* **Use High Contrast Images:** Use images with high contrast between the foreground and background. This will make it easier for users with low vision to see the images.

**Links**

* **Provide Link Text:** Provide clear and descriptive link text. This will help users understand where the link will take them.

* **Use Descriptive Link Names:** Use descriptive link names for bookmarks and other navigation elements. This will help users understand where the links will take them.

**Tagging**

* **Tag the Document:** Tag the document when you convert it to PDF. This will ensure that the logical structure of the document is preserved in the PDF file and that screen readers and other assistive technology can properly read the document.
### Additional Tips

* **Use a consistent font and font size:** Use a consistent font and font size throughout the document. This will make it easier for users to read the document.

* **Use white space effectively:** Use white space to break up the text and make it easier to read.

* **Use a clear and concise writing style:** Use a clear and concise writing style that is easy to understand.

* **Proofread the document carefully:** Proofread the document carefully to ensure that there are no errors.

By following these guidelines, you can create accessible PDFs that are easy for everyone to use.

To ensure that the reading order including moving from text and bullet lists to the alt text of graphics works correctly, follow these steps:

1. **Create a logical reading order for your content.** This means that the content should flow in a way that makes sense to the reader. For example, you should group related content together and use headings and subheadings to indicate the hierarchy of the information.
2. **Use paragraph styles to define the different parts of your content.** This will help screen readers understand the structure of your document and read it in the correct order. For example, you can use different paragraph styles for headings, body text, and bullet lists.
3. **Provide alt text for all images and graphics.** Alt text is a textual description of an image that is read by screen readers to users who are visually impaired. Make sure your alt text is clear and concise and accurately describes the image.
4. **Use the Articles panel to organize your content.** The Articles panel allows you to group related content together and control the reading order of the content. To use the Articles panel, drag the objects you want to group into the panel, and then click the "New Article" button.
5. **Preview your document in Adobe Acrobat.** Adobe Acrobat is a PDF reader that has a built-in accessibility checker. You can use the accessibility checker to check your document for errors and make sure that the reading order is correct.


By following these steps, you can ensure that your PDF document is accessible to everyone.

Here are some additional tips for ensuring that your reading order is correct:

* Test your document with
	1. The [PAC 2024 PDF accessibility tool ](https://pac.pdf-accessibility.org/en) - this is an essential tool and will help to give guidance on any accesssibility problems. It is the industry standard tool
	2. A range of screen readers. There are many different screen readers available, [NVDA Access](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/) is a free version that is widely used (Windows 8.1+). Browsers also have basic readers but they are not likely the ones used by users with significant disabilities.
	3.  InDesign and Adobe Acrobat have their own PDF checkers - good to use in combination with 1. above.
* If possible, ask someone who is visually impaired to review your document. This is a great way to get feedback on your document and make sure that it is easy to read for everyone.
* Use a consistent style throughout your document. This will make it easier for users to follow the reading order.
* Use clear and concise language. This will make it easier for users to understand your content.
* Break up your text into smaller chunks. This will make it easier for users to read your document.
* Use headings and subheadings to indicate the hierarchy of your information. This will help users understand the structure of your document.
* Use bullet lists and numbered lists to organise your content. This will make it easier for users to scan your document and find the information they are looking for.

By following these tips, you can create a PDF document that is easy to read and understand for everyone.
