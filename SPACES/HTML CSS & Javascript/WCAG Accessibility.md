### Website compliance checklist

From dotCMS website [Website Accessibility Checklist: 10 Steps Towards Website Compliance](https://www.dotcms.com/blog/post/website-accessibility-checklist-10-steps-towards-website-compliance)

1. **Screen-reader Compatible Web Pages**
Web pages must be readable by electronic “screen readers” — which are devices commonly used by the visually impaired to surf the internet.

2. **Alt-tagged Images**
Images must have “alt tags” (a type of metadata) which will help visually-impaired users to identify the image via text or via a screen reader. Search engine optimizers will know of alt-tags as a way to optimize images for ranking high in ‘Google Images’.

3. **Alt-tagged Tables**
If you’re using tables on any web pages, they must also have alt-tags — similar to those used with images — to help explain each column via text. The user’s screen-reader will then read that text aloud, describing the contents of the table.   

4. **Automatic Scripting**
Any scripted display usage of image mapping should be accompanied by textual alternatives.

5. **Style Sheet Independence**
Your web pages shouldn’t need a stylesheet to display in a way that is understandable. They should be readable to screen readers, most of which cannot load style sheets.

6. **Accessible Forms**
Web forms should be usable even without a mouse, and each field should be labeled.

7. **Text Links to Plugins**
If your website requires a specific plugin to work correctly, you should present the link to that plugin in text form.  

8. **Inclusive Color Schemes**
Your website should not contain any colors or color combinations that are either integral to the correct usage of your website, or which may confuse those with color blindness in any way pertaining to your website, products or services.

9. **Keyboard-friendly Browsing**
Your website shouldn’t be reliant on the usage of a mouse or touchpad. Users who wish to navigate using only keyboard keys should be able to do so.

10. **Harmless Website Design**
Your website should not serve images or videos that can cause seizures.
