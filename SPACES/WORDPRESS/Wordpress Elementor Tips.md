### Note:
The following contains any tips and procedures found related to Elementor and using this with WordPress
1. Template Editor images look correct but live site images show only original size
	- Problem found to be that Bitnami WordPress is only using http and this is hardcoded in the /opt/bitnami/wordpress/wp-config.php file (if the http settings show greyed out in the Wp general settings page)
	- Go to wp-config.php and alter these lines to show https (they will be on http)
