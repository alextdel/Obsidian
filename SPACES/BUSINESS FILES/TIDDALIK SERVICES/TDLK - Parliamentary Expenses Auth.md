**IPEA’s Style guide:**

Attached is a copy of IPEA’s Style Sheet for your reference.

**Existing published resources:**

To allow for alignment with existing published resources please review the content on IPEA’s website at [https://www.ipea.gov.au/education/pems-education-and-resources](https://www.ipea.gov.au/education/pems-education-and-resources).

**Log-in information for PEMS Quality Assurance System (QAS):**

The quality assurance system for PEMS can be accessed as below. This environment contains ‘dummy’ accounts and data to allow for testing and creation of materials such as this project. Some screens (and approval processes) are different as a ‘Parliamentarian’ or ‘Staff’ (MoP(s) Act employee) member - this will be stipulated in the steps we’ll provide for each resource.

Following your first log on you will need to setup a **2-factor authentication** with a mobile number. Please follow the prompts and let me know if you encounter any issues.

QAS: [https://qas.pems.gov.au/](https://qas.pems.gov.au/)

![[Pasted image 20230523172306.png]]

Please note, I am working to confirm the additional credentials you may need to access the budgets screen for the 2nd priority above. I will provide these as soon as available.

**Sharing large files:**

You will shortly receive an email invite to join a GovTeams channel ‘IPEA external collaboration and file share’ to allow for large file sharing between yourself and IPEA over the coming months. This email will provide steps on how to setup an account to access this channel. Please let us know if you would like Greg Golder and/or Alex Delaforce added to this channel.

**Instructional documentation for each resource:**

I will forward the approved steps (and script) for each resource in a separate email as these are finalised by IPEA. The first priority (Acquit advance travel allowance claim) steps and script will be sent through by 1pm today. I expect to be able to send through the 2nd & 3rd priority information by COB Wednesday.

If you have any early questions or concerns about this information, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

Kind regards

Renee
