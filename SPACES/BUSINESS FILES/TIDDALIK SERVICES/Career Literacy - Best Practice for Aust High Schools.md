### Best Practice

Teaching high school students about career literacy and training pathways is an important aspect of preparing them for their future careers. Some best practices approaches to include when designing instructional material and experiences includes:

1.  Use a variety of teaching methods: High school students have different learning styles, and it is important to use a range of teaching methods to cater to these styles. For example, using videos, case studies, guest speakers, and hands-on activities can help engage students and keep them interested in the topic.
    
2.  Make it relevant: High school students are often focused on the present and may not see the relevance of learning about future careers. It is important to make the topic relevant by discussing real-world examples, such as jobs in their community or in-demand careers that relate to their interests.
    
3.  Focus on self-awareness: Before students can explore career options, they need to have a good understanding of themselves. Teach students to identify their strengths, weaknesses, interests, and values to help them make informed decisions about their future.
    
4.  Provide exposure to different career paths: Provide students with information about a range of careers, including those that require a college degree, trade school, or apprenticeship. Consider organizing job shadowing experiences, internships, and guest speaker events to give students a chance to learn from professionals.
    
5.  Teach job search skills: Help students develop job search skills, including resume writing, interviewing, and networking. These skills are important for students to have as they prepare for their future careers.
    
6.  Collaborate with community resources: Partner with local businesses, non-profit organisations, and government agencies to provide students with a wide range of resources and opportunities related to career exploration and training pathways. These can often provide students with real-world experiences and connections to the job market. Typical examples include job shadowing opportunities, internships, and guest speakers from different industries.
    

By implementing these best practices, high school teachers can help students develop the career literacy and training pathway knowledge they need to make informed decisions about their future.

### Possible Contacts and Sources of Information

Some key sources of information to consider when exploring best practices for teaching career literacy and training pathways in the Australian context:

1.  **Australian Curriculum**: The Australian Curriculum provides guidelines for what students should be learning at each grade level, including career education. Teachers can use the curriculum as a framework for developing lessons that align with national standards.
    
2.  **MyFuture**: MyFuture is an online tool developed by the Australian government to help students explore career options and develop career plans. The website provides information on different occupations, education and training pathways, and job search skills.
    
3.  **Job Outlook**: Job Outlook is another online resource developed by the Australian government. It provides information on hundreds of occupations, including job prospects, typical earnings, and required qualifications.
    
4.  **Australian Apprenticeships**: Australian Apprenticeships is a government initiative that provides information and support for students interested in pursuing apprenticeships and traineeships. The website includes a directory of available apprenticeships and traineeships, as well as information on how to find and apply for these opportunities.
    
5.  **Industry bodies and professional associations:** Many industries and professions have their own bodies and associations that can provide valuable information on career paths, training requirements, and job opportunities. Examples include the Australian Medical Association, Engineers Australia, and the Australian Retailers Association.
    
6.  **Local employers and community organizations:** High schools can also work with local employers and community organizations to provide students with real-world experiences and connections to the job market. This can include job shadowing opportunities, internships, and guest speakers from different industries.

### GRATTAN Institute publications

"What works to improve school education: Evidence review" (2019) discusses a wide range of issues related to school education, including career and vocational education. It contains recommendations for improving career education, such as providing students with more information about career options and vocational pathways, and providing better career guidance and counselling services.

Another report is "Catching up: Learning from the best school systems in East Asia" which was published in 2017. This report examines the education systems of several East Asian countries, including Japan and South Korea, and provides recommendations for improving education in Australia. One of the recommendations relates to career education, and suggests that Australia should provide more opportunities for students to gain real-world experience and connect with industry professionals.
    

These articles and reports, along with others published by ACER, can provide valuable insights and guidance for teachers and schools looking to improve their career education programs and practices.
