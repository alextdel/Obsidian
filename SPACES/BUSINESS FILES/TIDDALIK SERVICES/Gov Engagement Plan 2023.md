### Note:
#### Recommendations
##### 1. Website p7.
1. **Policies**
   Government departments like to use organisations that align with their philosophy and values. This can be signalled by TDLK through the website with a range of policy declarations and signs
	- Environmental management policy
	- Diversity policy
	- Domestic and Family Violence policy
	- Indigenous Support/Supply policy
	- Corporate Social Responsibility Policy
***Action Item*** - Policy and Values Statements including documents and webpages. [Lawpath ](https://lawpath.com.au/) provides templates - consider a months subscription to  download templates.

2. **Website Homepage**
	1. What problem is TDLK solving? - needs to be a clear statement on the front page in place of the 'Inspiring a Thirst for Knowledge'. Should be 1 or 2 sentences only - what problem are we solving for government and corporate clients.
   ***Action Item*** - Write and agree on a mission statement that explains precisely what problems we see to solve for government and corporate clients 
   Something like ... 
   > "One place for reliable, scalable and agile education and information delivery needs."*
   > Some suggestions from Chat GPT are here [[Ideas for Mission Statement (website)]]
   > Suggestion from report writers - *We Bring Learning to Life* p8.

3. **About Us**
	1. The descriptions of staff are too dry. Revise to include personalities and have some fun with this.
		- Use 1st person in the personnel description pieces - again, lighten up.
	2.  Include why and how Tiddalik was established and the customers Tiddalik serves
	3. Include a short one-sentence testimonial at the top of the section - 3rd party endorsement
	4. Some points about good About Us pages
		1. The page itself is simple, aesthetically pleasing, and loads quickly.
		2. It features photos of the team that seamlessly fit into the page design.
		3. The colours and tones used matched the rest of the site, creating consistency across all pages.
		4. It covers the brands vision and goals using inspirational, engaging copywriting.
		5. The call-to-action button sits on the right of the page and always remains visible.
		6. It's free of unnecessary words and get straight to the point.
		7. It features case studies, a client list, and their credentials. This is all in plain sight, for all to see.
		8. They feature multiple testimonials (although this could be improved by slowing down the carousel or giving users the ability to scroll at their own speed).
		9. Linked to other informative website, if these help visitors to learn more about the brand and its history.
		10. It showcases any focus on things like social awareness,  community engagement, humanitarian work etc. Maybe in a ‘giving and causes’ section. [See p10](obsidian://open?vault=My%20Personal%20Vault&file=Gov%20Engagement%20Plan%202023). for example graphics
***Action Item*** - Design effective About Us page using above notes.
			    
4. **Company story/history**
	TDLK has an excellent story to tell and should share this with customers. How was Tiddalik born?
***Action Item*** - Formulate a succinct company story and include it on the About Us page. These stories can also be put on proposals and marketing collateral - not too long or wordy though.
Why? - encourages emotional engagement with the clients and encourages brand loyalty - people love a story. [See pp.11 - 13](obsidian://open?vault=My%20Personal%20Vault&file=Gov%20Engagement%20Plan%202023) for examples.
  
5. **Dedicated Government Landing Page**
		1. Consider a basic one-page Government landing page. Doesn't need to be fancy - should give short and succinct summary of the services on offer to government decision makers - see [Mastercom](https://www.mastercom.com.au/industries/local-government/) example on [p.14](obsidian://open?vault=My%20Personal%20Vault&file=Gov%20Engagement%20Plan%202023)
***Action Item*** - Add a Government page to the website.
1. **Services - description to feature video of Greg and Rob**
***Action Item*** - design a short services video with Rob and Greg. Include at the top section of the Services page. Should describe the solutions on offer and the services available.
