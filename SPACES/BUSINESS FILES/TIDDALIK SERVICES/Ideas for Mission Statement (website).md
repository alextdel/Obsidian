> A group of three educators from secondary education are forming a startup company. Their clients will be government departments, corporate organisations, and other educational and training organisations. The range of services will be resource design and production including electronic and online resources, the provision of online learning management systems, educational consultancy for government and corporate clients, accessibility compliant resource (production and editing), presentation of information in face to face and online modes, presentation of training materials in face to face and online modes, course design, instructional design and educational gap analysis. The company will work with client subject matter experts where required. As a small startup we intend to be agile and scalable and react to the needs of clients through employing staff, networking with other suppliers and obtaining resources in accordance with our needs. We want to provide quality solutions that encourage repeat business. Of the three of us one is a Head of Junior Secondary School with a history of building and maintaining teams of educators, liaising with school leadership and working with students and their families to bring about and manage satisfactory educational experiences. One of us is currently a Head of Teaching and Learning who coordinates and leads curriculum and pedagogy development, leads teacher teams in improvement programs and who also has a high level experience of technology use and management, and leading the technology, network and IT resource planning, development and delivery effort within schools. The third person is a Maths and Science Teacher with a background in pastoral care and liaising with parents, he is also technologically adept and is experienced in instructional design and technology use in educational settings. We are designing our website and need a front page statement of the the problem we are intending to solve for our government and corporate clients. This needs to be a clear statement of 1 or 2 sentences that forms a mission statement of our intent and approach. Given the information I have provided, would you suggest some possible statements that would suit being placed on our website to clearly communicate our point of difference and the statement of mission?
