### Note:
### WP Mail SMTP 
This plugin is used for connecting WP to an SMTP service.
I chose the SendInBlue service - credentials in Bitwarden.

Used the WP Mail SMTP plugin - this required signup to an SMTP service.

### SendInBlue
SMTP service that is free for up to a limited number of emails.

Log in to [SendInBlue](https://app.sendinblue.com/account/login)
Credentials in Bitwarden.

### DNS Consequences

#### DNS and SendInBlue

Sending email requires an SMTP server and setting up the DNS so that a mail server can check the authenticity of the source of Tiddalik Services emails.

The help and step by step guides in the SendInBlue service webpages will give full guidance

**Note:**
When changing from staging to production, the Wordpress plugin and DNS may need updating.
