3. GoDaddy DNS
	- change staging.learn A Record to **54.66.18.60**
4. Run the Let's Encrypt app on the new server - if the email address is unknown find in this directory ` /opt/bitnami/letsencrypt/accounts/acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org`
	  - for staging.learn.tiddalik.com.au and learn.tiddalik.com.au use
	   admin01@tiddalikservices.com.au
5. Once the server and the database are up and DNS in 3. is complete then update the config.php file ```~/htdocs/config.php```
6. Check these settings
   ![[Moodle Config_php file for TDLKLrn.png]]
	- Note 1. the database password will be new 
	- Note 2. for the AWS Lightsail databases the database type is mysql so use the **mysqli** type
   
7. don't forget to clean up - saves money
	- delete unwanted databases
	-  delete unwanted servers 
	-  decommission / delete static IPs
