### Note:
AppArmor is a system used in Debian and other similar OSs it takes the place or overrides the permission system of using merely file permissions.
See the [Ubuntu AppArmor Profile guide](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/beginning-apparmor-profile-development#1-overview) for how to do some basic set ups for an application.
An example of the problems that can arise from incorrect AppArmor set up is when msmtp is run and fails to write to log files regardless of ownership or permission settings.

For an introduction to AppArmor see the [Debian Administrator's Handbook](https://debian-handbook.info/browse/stable/sect.apparmor.html) The PDF of book here [[debian-handbook.pdf]]
