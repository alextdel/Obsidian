### Note:
Badges are awarded based on passing criteria in Moodle. 

There are Site Badges and Course Badges - see [General Badges page](https://docs.moodle.org/400/en/Badges)

This is related to the Activity Completion function. Awarding happens according to two typical methods:
- Method 1:
	Set a passing grade for the quiz in the gradebook, as explained in section 1.3 of [Activity completion settings](https://docs.moodle.org/400/en/Activity_completion_settings "Activity completion settings").
- Method 2:
	1.  Create a page resource and set the restrict access conditions so that it only appears if the user obtains a certain activity grade or course total
	2.  Set the activity completion for the page as "view"
	3.  Set the badge criteria such that the page has to be completed (i.e. viewed)

#### Dimensions 
- A badge is displayed in Moodle with dimensions 100 x 100 pixels. However, we recommend that you upload a larger image, such as 400 x 400, as this is the size the badge is displayed if users upload their badge to a Badgr backpack. [See here for more detail](https://docs.moodle.org/400/en/Badges_FAQ)
- See the Moodle page on Badges to learn more about backpacks, collections and how Moodle badges can be imported into other systems.
