### Set up and other notes
1. MariaDB is installed on the host Ubuntu server
2. Each Webmin domain has a database
	1. *tiddalik.com.au* domain has a mariadb called *tiddalikadmin*
		- user: *tiddalikadmin*
		- passwd: *rZ6SigJfdaov339*
	- Logging in to tiddalikadmin and running `Mariadb> show databases;` gives

	  ```sql
MariaDB [(none)]> show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| learn              |
| staging            |
| tiddalikadmin      |
+--------------------+
4 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

This shows that: 
- *learn.tiddalik.com.au* domain is a sub domain of tiddalik.com.au and has a mariadb called *learn*
- *staging.learn.tiddalik.com.au* domain is a sub domain of tiddalik.com.au and has a mariadb called *staging*
