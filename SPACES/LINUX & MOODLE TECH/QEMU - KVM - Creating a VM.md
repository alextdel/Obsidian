### Note:
This note shows installing a VM on a previously set up QEMU KVM system.
See [[QEMU and KVM setup]] to set up the system on Arch - tested on EndeavourOS. 

### Using virt-manager

VMs can be set up using the command line but *virt-manager* is the easier option. Look for *Virtual Machine Manager* in the applications menu.

### Using a physical SSD for a Win 10 VM

The installation of a VM can be made to existing partitions, virtual disks (effectively a file on an existing file system) or to a physical device, such as a spare SSD. 
The following shows how to install on a spare SSD.
1. Find the SSD identifier eg. /dev/sdb or /dev/nvme1n1
2. Use a partitioning tool like gnome-disk-utility to delete all existing partitions.
3. Start Virt Manager
4. In Virt Manager select 'New VM'

5. Select how you would like to install the operating system. In this case, we are using a Windows 10 ISO image. Click forward and choose the Windows 10 ISO. 

### Installing windows using the ISO

1. When the installation starts, you will select a disk drive as the installation location will be blank.

	- Select Load driver
	- Click on _Browse_ and expand the _CD Drive that contains the Virtio drivers - previously downloaded and set up as a CDROM source within the Virt-manager settings. Drivers can be downloaded from [here](https://fedorapeople.org/groups/virt/virtio-win/direct-downloads/stable-virtio/virtio-win.iso)  
	- Expand the __viostor__ folder, then __w10__ and then the CPU architecture (eg. __amd64__).
	- Once done, click _Next_ and it should install the driver.
	- 
	***Note*** - Some guides recommend installing the network drivers and the display drivers as well. This can be done by repeating the same process but select:
		- for the network: the __NetKVM__ folder and
		- for the video drivers: the __qxldod__ folder.

4. Set up a partition on the SSD to use as a passthrough drive for the VM.
   eg. /dev/nvme0n1p2 
2.  make sure the Windows10 iso is available on a fast SSD if possible.
3.
