Learning or knowledge building can take many forms. Most often in the articles which appear on Tiddalik Services and its associated sites we will refer to learning, teaching and skill development. This could lead a reader to believe we provide resources and services only for learning projects in schools, colleges, training organisations and similar situations. In fact, Tiddalik's services and the skills and experience of the Tiddalik team enables us to support all information, knowledge and skill development projects. Our work sees us working, collaborating and training with employees, specialist and social groups, colleges, training organisations, schools, government departments, member of the public as well as other trainers, information professionals, teachers, tradies, academics, administrators and many more. 

In reality there are an infinite number of ways of presenting information, guiding learning and assessing progress. Which of these is possible, preferable or effective depends on a wide range of factors related to the specific learning needed, the client or student's motivation, the skills of the instructor, the mode of  presentation etc, etc. For practical purposes we can group all the ways of engaging our client or student in their knowledge aquisition into 3 + 1 modes. 

The first three are where the information to be shared or the training to be carried out is delivered to a person or group by an instructor, presenter, teacher, trainer or team of information specialists or educators. The '+1' is where a person wholly sources, manages and is self-motivated to research, learn and usually produce their own knowledge without support or reference to any other persons or organisations. 'Self-managed learning' is an important topic but not the subject of this article.
The three 'supported modes' of learning are 
- **face-to-face learning** (f2f) - alternatively called *onsite* or *in-person* learning
- online learning - also called virtual or web-based learning
