##### Q. What is the rsync command to synchronise a directory between two AWS server instances running Bitnami LAMP images using ssh

##### A.
The `rsync` command is a useful tool for synchronizing files and directories between two servers. To use `rsync` to synchronize a directory between two AWS server instances running Bitnami LAMP images using SSH, you can use the following command:

`rsync -avz -e "ssh -i /path/to/private-key.pem" /path/to/local/directory/ ec2-user@<remote-server-ip>:/path/to/remote/directory`

In this command, the `-avz` options are used to enable verbose output, archive mode (which preserves file permissions, timestamps, etc.), and compression. 

The `-e` option is used to specify the ssh command and the private key file to use for authentication.

The `/path/to/local/directory/` should be replaced with the absolute path of the local directory that you want to synchronize, and the `ec2-user@<remote-server-ip>:/path/to/remote/directory` should be replaced with the remote server's IP address and the absolute path of the remote directory that you want to synchronize.

It's worth noting that, you should make sure that the ssh is configured on both instances, and both instances should be able to reach each other. Also, you should also check that the user running the command on the local server has permissions to access and read the files on the local server and the same applies to the remote server.
