### Note:

> As a new Gold Coast-based startup indigenous business, your Tiddalik team certainly has a wealth of knowledge and experience behind it with your combined over 70 years in training and educational leadership, teaching, and learner support – working in face to face, online web services and virtual learning environments. This is evident by your impressive range of products and service offering i.e.
> 
> -   _Tiddalik Learn_ – your online learning platform specialising in the design and delivery of face-to-face and technology-based education content that is interactive, engaging, and accessible to learners of all levels;
> -   _Tiddalik_ _Services_ – your range of consultancy, mentoring and curriculum advice to educators, learners and industry clients;
> -   Tiddalik Screens - the innovative proprietary interactive digital educational tool (for recording instructional and demonstration videos) you have developed.  I note that you outsource its manufacture locally, and manufacturing is not Tiddalik’s core business focus.
> 
> You are already off to a great start – having recently made a tender submission for the Education Queensland’s ‘Parent Advocates’ program; participated in an Indigenous Tender Writing seminar; already registered with Supply Nation; and having a live website and social media content ready for next year’s business launch.
> 
> To further assist, below is a summary of startup, product development, and business development support options for your consideration.

If Tiddalik is spending money to experimentally solve technical problems or experimentally develop new products or services to generate new knowledge, it may qualify for a **tax offset for some of the costs of doing** [**eligible R&D**](https://business.gov.au/grants-and-programs/research-and-development-tax-incentive/assess-if-your-randd-activities-are-eligible) by reducing the company’s income tax liability.
