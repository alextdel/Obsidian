### Note:
*Q. We are an educational technology company who will host, configure, launch and maintain a learning management system website for our client based on Moodle. The site will be used by approximately 700 students. Knowing this, what is a typical costing structure that would help us answer the following 1. What is the cost of the LMS? Does the LMS have a one-time set up fee? ◦ Are there any usage fees associated with the LMS? ◦ Is there a subscription/monthly fee for using the LMS? ◦ Are there any additional costs for customization or support?*

A. The cost of the LMS and its associated fees can vary depending on the hosting provider, the features and customization required, and the level of support needed. Generally speaking, there are several cost factors to consider:

1.  Initial Setup Fee: Some LMS providers may charge a one-time setup fee to configure and launch the LMS site. This fee can vary depending on the complexity of the setup and the level of customization required.
    
2.  Usage Fees: Depending on the LMS provider, there may be usage fees associated with the number of users, courses, and data storage required. This can be a flat fee or charged on a per-user basis.
    
3.  Subscription/Monthly Fee: Most LMS providers charge a monthly or annual subscription fee to use their software. This fee can vary depending on the number of users, the features required, and the level of support needed.
    
4.  Customization and Support Costs: If additional customization or support is needed beyond the initial setup, there may be additional costs associated with these services. Customization fees can vary depending on the level of complexity, while support fees may be charged on an hourly basis or as a monthly retainer.
    

Based on the information provided, a rough estimate for an LMS hosting and support package for 700 users on Moodle could range from $5,000 to $15,000 per year, depending on the level of customization and support needed. It's important to research and compare LMS providers to find the best fit for your client's needs and budget.

*Q. What stages are normal for a software project of this type from initial engagement through to BAU?*

A software project for an LMS implementation typically involves several stages from the initial engagement through to BAU (business as usual) support. Here are some of the common stages:

1.  Requirements gathering: The first stage involves understanding the client's requirements, objectives, and expectations for the LMS implementation. This stage includes defining the scope of the project, the desired features and functionality, and any customization or integration needs.
    
2.  Planning and design: Once the requirements are gathered, the next stage involves creating a plan and design for the LMS implementation. This includes creating a project timeline, defining roles and responsibilities, and developing a solution architecture and design.
    
3.  Development and testing: In this stage, the LMS platform is developed, customized, and tested. This includes creating custom themes, plugins, and integrations, as well as configuring the platform to meet the client's requirements. Testing is conducted to ensure that the LMS functions as expected and meets the client's requirements.
    
4.  Launch and deployment: Once the LMS is developed and tested, it is deployed to a production environment. This stage includes configuring the LMS on the production environment, migrating data from the development environment, and ensuring that the platform is secure and stable.
    
5.  Training and support: After the LMS is deployed, training and support are provided to the client's users. This includes training on how to use the platform, creating user manuals and guides, and providing ongoing support to resolve any issues or questions that arise.
    
6.  Maintenance and updates: Once the LMS is in production, it requires ongoing maintenance and updates to ensure that it remains secure, stable, and up-to-date with the latest features and functionality.
    
7.  Business as usual (BAU): Finally, the LMS is in BAU stage where the platform is being used by the client for their teaching and learning activities. In this stage, the LMS provider provides ongoing support and maintenance to ensure that the platform continues to meet the client's needs.
    
These stages may overlap and vary depending on the specific requirements of the project and the LMS provider's methodology.

*Q. can you suggest a suggested timeline for stages 1 to 7 if we make a simplifying assumption that the stages do not overlap?*

Sure! Here's a suggested timeline for each stage, assuming that the stages do not overlap:

1.  Requirements gathering: 2-4 weeks
2.  Planning and design: 4-6 weeks
3.  Development and testing: 8-12 weeks
4.  Launch and deployment: 2-4 weeks
5.  Training and support: 2-4 weeks
6.  Maintenance and updates: Ongoing
7.  Business as usual (BAU): Ongoing

It's worth noting that the actual timeline may vary depending on the complexity of the project, the level of customization and integration required, and the availability of resources. It's important to work closely with the LMS provider to develop a detailed project plan and timeline that takes into account the specific needs and requirements of the project.

*Q. What would be the expected staffing requirements for completing these stages*

The staffing requirements for completing the stages of an LMS implementation project can vary depending on the complexity of the project and the resources available. Here's a rough estimate of the roles and the expected number of team members for each stage:

1.  Requirements gathering: Project Manager (1), Business Analyst (1-2), Subject Matter Expert (1-2), Technical Analyst (1)
    
2.  Planning and design: Project Manager (1), Business Analyst (1-2), Solution Architect (1), User Interface (UI) Designer (1), Technical Analyst (1)
    
3.  Development and testing: Project Manager (1), Business Analyst (1), Solution Architect (1), UI Designer (1), Front-end Developer (1-2), Back-end Developer (1-2), Quality Assurance (QA) Analyst (1-2), Technical Analyst (1)
    
4.  Launch and deployment: Project Manager (1), Technical Analyst (1), Deployment Specialist (1), Quality Assurance (QA) Analyst (1)
    
5.  Training and support: Project Manager (1), Technical Trainer (1), Technical Writer (1), Support Specialist (1-2)
    
6.  Maintenance and updates: Project Manager (1), Technical Analyst (1-2), Developer (1-2), Quality Assurance (QA) Analyst (1-2), Support Specialist (1-2)
    
7.  Business as usual (BAU): Technical Analyst (1-2), Developer (1-2), Quality Assurance (QA) Analyst (1-2), Support Specialist (1-2)
    
It's worth noting that the team size and roles can vary depending on the size of the project, the level of customization and integration required, and the expertise and experience of the team members. It's important to work closely with the LMS provider to determine the specific staffing requirements for each stage of the project.

*Q. What would the expected client be charged for the setup and deployment stages prior to the establishment of the ongoing BAU costs*

The cost of setup and deployment stages for an LMS implementation project can vary widely depending on the complexity of the project, the level of customization required, and the expertise of the team members involved. Additionally, the pricing structure can vary depending on the LMS provider.

As a rough estimate, the setup and deployment stages can range from $20,000 to $100,000, or even more, depending on the factors mentioned above. This cost typically includes the initial setup, configuration, and launch of the LMS, as well as any required integrations, customizations, and data migrations.

It's important to note that this estimate is only for the setup and deployment stages and does not include ongoing support, maintenance, and hosting costs. The ongoing costs can be charged on a monthly or annual basis and can range from a few hundred dollars to thousands of dollars, depending on the number of users, the level of support required, and the hosting provider.

It's essential to work closely with the LMS provider to determine the specific pricing structure and cost estimate for the project based on the specific needs and requirements of the client.
