# Using GIT and symbolic links

### Note:
This is an example of using symbolic links to streamline maintenance processes. 

In this we move the contents of a website directory to a backup copy location but because we haven't finished the upgrade task we use create a link so the web server still functions.

```$ mv www www_old && ln -s www_old www ```

note 1. The **&&** causes the second command *ln* to run immediately after the first *mv*.

note 2. **ln -s** is the command to create a symbolic link. 
		Syntax:: ```$ ln -s <destination> <source> ```
