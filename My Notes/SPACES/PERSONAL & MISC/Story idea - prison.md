The woman is in prison, this gives an avenue for exposition. Is she in for murder or baby stealing - caught on street or hospital cameras?
The man and baby are thought to have been killed in the swollen river. 

Red herrings - we assume the woman is stealing the baby but is in fact saving the baby from being trafficked - the man who we assume has died is the key which is assumed lost but saves the day eventually?
