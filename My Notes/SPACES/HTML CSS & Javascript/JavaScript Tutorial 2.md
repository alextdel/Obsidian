## Separation of Concerns

In real projects the JavaScript will be separated out from the HTML code
1. Create a file in the VS Code Explorer called *index.js*
2. Cut and paste the code into the *index.js* file
   ```Javascript
// Comment describing the why and how of the script
// Save this file then 'Open with Live Server' from VS Code Explorer
console.log('Hello world');
```
3. Refer to the new JS script file in the HTML file using ... ![[Pasted image 20240411094950.png|200]]
4. Save and test using the browser console (Ctrl+Shft+k) - the console should still display "Hello World"
**Note:**
JavaScript is white-space sensitive so make sure the `console.log` line starts at the beginning of the line.
