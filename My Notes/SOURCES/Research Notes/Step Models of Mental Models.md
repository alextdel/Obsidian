### What was the most important thing about the text?
- ([Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1980, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/XD5R9H7C)) This report outlines an important aspect to be realised about how to consider the interpretation and relevance of findings of tightly controlled research projects. These findings, though reproducible in the context of the same tightly controlled conditions, often do not translate to accurate prediction of events in concrete situations, that is real contexts.
- Psychology and philosophy has a tradition of being suspicious experimental results that come from experiments involving precisely controlled but highly artificial conditions. 
- 
- As a consequence [[@DreyfusDreyfus1980]] derive their findings from the investigation of mental activity in authentic in-context activities by study participants.

([Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1980, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/XD5R9H7C)) Repeated practising of recognising features and applying rules is done in real situations and the result is the ability to recognise situated features. These are called ‘aspects’. The recognition of aspects is not merely the ability to recall sets of features but to recal specific clear examples of features and rule use in specific contexts.

“no longer the context-free features” ([Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1980, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/XD5R9H7C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H57TBN3U?page=12&annotation=M9MR58YJ))

“aspects.” ([Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1980, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/XD5R9H7C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H57TBN3U?page=12&annotation=3D2U93JW))

“perspicuous examples” ([Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1980, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/XD5R9H7C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H57TBN3U?page=12&annotation=E5M34AGM))

([Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1980, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/XD5R9H7C)) Drefus and Dreyfus tell us that the brain state correlated with competence is that the person can recall examples where aspects are applicable. There is no evidence that this brain state can be decomposed into “bits of information” - that is stored as individual aspect recognising

([Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1980, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/XD5R9H7C)) When a person can recognise the aspects in example situations the instructor can offer guidelines so the competence becomes being able to know and use the guidelines to apply the correct rules when aspects are encountered.

“guidelines.” ([Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1980, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/XD5R9H7C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H57TBN3U?page=12&annotation=PC6796KB))

([Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1980, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/XD5R9H7C)) With increased practice, the person experiences a wide range of whole situations where the situation relates to an objective. Relative aspects can now be drawn up on and prioritised depending on the objective. Aspects applied in different goal settings are seperate and treated as separate situations. The set of aspects and their importance in given situations are learned as maxims which are used to determine the action to be taken.

“a memorized principle which we call a maxim” ([Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1980, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/XD5R9H7C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H57TBN3U?page=14&annotation=X5UG7IW7))

([Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1980, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/XD5R9H7C)) When the person has learned a wide range of analytical principals (rule, guideline, maxim) to connect situations with specific actions these become intuitively part of how a person acts within their performance context. Each type of specific situation now has an internalised and learned response. This is now expertise - an automatic and intuitive skill set.

“specific situation immediately dictates an intuitively appropriate action.” ([Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1980, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/XD5R9H7C)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/H57TBN3U?page=16&annotation=DGEMB5E9))

([Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1980, p. 18](zotero://select/library/items/XD5R9H7C)) Mastery - though not explicitly contained within Dreyfus and Dreyfus’s stage model, they refer to mastery which is the experience of no longer needing principles to bring about a masterful performance.
