# 2012 Voogt et al - Technological pedagogical content knowledge - a review of the literature


1.  Cox and Graham (2009) emphasised the relationship between TPACK and PCK.
    
    *   They further claim that as soon as the technology has become transparent and ubiquitous in educational practice, it becomes part of PCK
    *   Because of this Cox and Graham referred to TPACK as a sliding framework.
    
    2.  They stress the importance of domain knowledge, that is TPACK being related to a particular subject.
