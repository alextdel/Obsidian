### Note:
Implementation Science gives a toolkit of resources to consider when looking at introducing initiatives. It is quite easy to see how these tools can be used within the broader approach to improvement offered by [[Appreciative Inquiry MOC]]

My original exposure to #Implementation_Science was through James Manion's podcast
[Reshaping Education: Implementation Science episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0CGplozJaI1xlBKnZVnESG?si=6e260eaab360401b)

In the podcast show notes, the following images are provided (see [ISS Visual Diagrams](https://gate.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Frethinking-ed.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F06%2FISS-VISUAL-DIAGRAMS.pdf&token=3a5cab-1-1655164762337) In the website that is referred to in the above podcast this set of graphics is available ![[ImplementationScienceVisuals.pdf]]
