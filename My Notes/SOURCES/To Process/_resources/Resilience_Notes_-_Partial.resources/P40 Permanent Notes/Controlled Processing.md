### Note:
'Controlled processing' ([[@SchneiderShiffrin1977]]) is not an  automated reaction to a context but rather the temporary employment of elements that are summoned for use. Controlled processing requires focussed attention and effort in order to complete the processing of the requirements of the event.

This level of processing relates to [[@DreyfusDreyfus1980]] mental  modes related to the [[Novice Stage]] and [[Competence Stage]] of skill acquisition.

### Quotes:
"Controlled processing is a temporary activation of a sequence of elements that can be set up quickly and easily but requires attention, is capacity-limited (usually serial in nature), and is controlled by the subject." [[@SchneiderShiffrin1977]] p.1
