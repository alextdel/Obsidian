I looked at aligning the [[Five Stage Model (Dreyfus & Dreyfus 1980)]]  with the [[Proficiency Scale]] with the 5-scale grading of A to E. Coming from different considerations of learning and development, these do not completely line up. However, the exercise may be useful when communicating to educators how to map different stages of student learning in a range of contexts from academic learning, learning growth, 'complex competencies' (General Capabilities), credentialing, PBL etc.
| Mental Modes | Proficiency Scale | Grade |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| [[@DreyfusDreyfus1980]] | Marzano etc. | QCAA/Aust Curric etc |
| **Think** | **Do** | **External Assessment** | 
| Mastery | Advanced | A |
|Expert|Advanced|A|
| Proficient |Proficient | B/C |
| Competent | Proficient | C |
| Novice | Developing | D |
| Novice | Beginner | D/E |
| -  | 0  | E |

Enterprise Professor Sandra Milligan, University of Melbourne has done a great deal of work around credentialling, student profiles and assessment of [[Complex Competencies]] such as those of the Australian Curriculum's 'General Capabilities' and other frameworks such as 21C Skills etc.
See this article on An alternative to ATAR which brings together ideas aimed at developing a trustworthy framework which students can use as credential in the form of a Learner Profile [An Alternative to ATAR](https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/an-alternative-to-atar)
