### Note:
'Automatic processing' ([[@SchneiderShiffrin1977]]), though not mentioned by Scheider and Shiffrin, relates to [[Routine Expertise]] in that routine expertise is where a person can summon and utilise processes from their memory that can be used without requiring undue thought, attention or effort. 
Automatic processing derives from practiced processes in similar situations so that eventually the detection or recognition of the situation stimulates recall and use of the process with little or no conscious effort.
[[@SchneiderShiffrin1977]]'s automatic processing describes a process involved in human information processing and is contrasted with [[Controlled Processing]] which appears in the article listed above and the associated [[@ShiffrinSchneider1977]] article.

### Quotes:
"Automatic processing is activation of a learned sequence of elements in long-term memory that is initiated by appropriate inputs and then proceeds automatically—without subject control, without stressing the capacity limitations of the system, and without necessarily demanding attention."  [[@SchneiderShiffrin1977]] p.1
