# Wikipedia 001 - Dreyfus model of skill acquisition


1.  Dreyfus and Dreyfus proposed a 5 stage model of the development of expertise
    1.  Novice
        *   "rigid adherence to taught rules or plans"
        *   no exercise of "discretionary judgment"
    2.  Advanced beginner
        *   limited "situational perception"
        *   all aspects of work treated separately with equal importance
    3.  Competent
        *   coping with crowdedness" (multiple activities, accumulation of information)
        *   some perception of actions in relation to goals
        *   deliberate planning
        *   formulates routines
    4.  Proficient
        *   holistic view of situation
        *   prioritizes importance of aspects
        *   "perceives deviations from the normal pattern"
        *   employs maxims for guidance, with meanings that adapt to the situation at hand
    5.  Expert
        *   transcends reliance on rules, guidelines, and maxims
        *   "intuitive grasp of situations based on deep, tacit understanding"
        *   has "vision of what is possible"
        *   uses "analytical approaches" in new situations or in case of problems
2.  Bent Flyvbjerg found that the original Dreyfus model in its original form does not account for innovation and the way that new wkills come into being and outcompete old ones. Flyvbjerg found this to be undynamic and unable to grasp skill acquisition in full. 
3.  Flyvbjerg suggested a sixth stage for innovation
4.  Though initially rejecting the 6th stage Hubert Dreyfus eventially embraced the new stage and even a 7th stage.
