# Moriceau 001 - Generalizability


1.  It is important that researchers approach the question of generalisability from the viewpoint of their understanding of the world from an ontological perspective.
2.  From the positivist perspective a case is not enough to give generalisability and a case study would likely be only of value if many cases were studied such as in the case of surveys.
3.  From the realist perspective the case study can yield understanding of the underlying reality that exists behind the specific case. Once the characteristics of the case have been discovered the realist would then look for further cases to demonstrate the generalisability of the findings.
4.  From the constructivist perspective a case is the specific personal mental construction. Thus the case stands alone and it is up to the reader to decide if any of the findings are relevant or generalisable to other cases.
5.  The postmodern researcher sees a problem with the existence of a case. It is seen as a particular framing of the world from one perspective. The postmodern use of a case is to look at the way in which we frame problems, representations and power relations that a society and academic sphere impose. This would likely look at the issue of who can speak and who is silenced. The main question from the point of view of a postmodern account of the world will concern itself with justice and exemplarity.
