# Lundblad, J. - 001 - A Review and Critique of Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation Theory as it Applies to Organizations


1.  Lundblad finds that DoI has great potential for use in organisations but sees that work is needed to more fully account for organisational rather than individuals in DoI. Lundblad also sees a wide range of important but unanswered research questions regarding DoI and organisations.
2.  Lundblad uses Dubin's framework for critiquing theories to critique Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations

3.  Units
    1.  Dubin's framework looks at the number of units or variables in a theory to see if they are well defined. Lundblad finds that the variables for DoI among individuals is well defined and there are many of them, however for organisations the number of variables is a lot less and they are less well defined.
4.  Laws of interaction
    1.  Lundblad finds that Dubin's 'laws of interaction' are well defined for individuals and for individuals within organisations but in the case of between organisation interactions the interaction laws are less well defined (in fact only the interaction of the individuals within the organisations across the boundary are defined) and the relationship between interactions and the organisational type, size or industry is not well catered for.
5.  Boundaries
    1.  Rogers' DoI theory uses social systems as a core concept, this grouping gives the boundaries that are needed within the DoI theory. However, in the case of organisational systems, which can be conglomerates of social systems which exist within and across organisational boundaries, the DoI is not well suited to cater for these complex situations. Between organisation diffusion is not catered for.
6.  System states
    1.  Lundblad finds that Rogers' DoI theory does not give clear information on the system states for organisations. 
7.  Propositions
    1.  Lundblad sees that the inclusion of more information regarding Units, Laws of Interactions, Boundaries and System States in the theory that pertain to organisations would bring more proposition or 'truths' into the theory in order to cater more effectively with the organisation as an entity being looked at through DoI theory.
8.  Empirical indicators
    1.  These are usable within the organisational situation as well as the case of individuals
9.  Hypotheses
    1.  The more the DoI theory accounts for organisations the more hypotheses can be generated.
