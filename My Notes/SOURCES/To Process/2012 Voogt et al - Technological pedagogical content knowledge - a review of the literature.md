# 2012 Voogt et al - Technological pedagogical content knowledge - a review of the literature


Voogt, J., Fisser, P., Roblin, N. P., Tondeur, J., & van Braak, J. (2012). Technological pedagogical content knowledge - a review of the literature. _Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, Advance on_. doi:10.1111/j.1365-2729.2012.00487.x

1.  Doering et al (2009) looked at the dynamic nature of TPACK as related to the bidirectional relationship between knowledge and practice. Types of knowledge that teachers use depends on their knowledge of pratice.
2.  Similarly, Bowers and Stephens (2011) argue that TPACK should be considered as an orientation more than as a fixed knowledge base. 
3.  From both these perspectives it is important to relate TPACK as the 'teachers' knowledge base for teaching with technology' to teachers' pedagogical and technological beliefs.
