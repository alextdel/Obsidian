# Berliner - 001 - Describing the behavior and documenting the accomplishments of expert teachers


1.  Presents 4 theories of teacher development and gives reasons why three are not sufficient to cover the development of expertise in the teacher context
2.  Gives characteristics of Expert Teachers
    1.  develop automaticity and routinisation for repetitive operations
    2.  more sensitive to task demands and social situations when solving pedagogical problems
    3.  more opportunistic and flexible in teaching than novices
    4.  represent problems in qualitatively different ways than novices
    5.  fast and accurate pattern recognition 
    6.  experience meaningful patterns in the domains in which they operate
    7.  bring richer and more personal sources of information to bear on the problem they are trying to solve  - although they may start slower.
3.  Link between expertise and improved student outcomes has been difficult to see although the example of the NBPTS certified teachers giving better results in students is an example of where this has been done.
4.  Berliner suggests the model of teacher growth in expertise by  Dreyfus and Dreyful
5.  MDL - Model of Domain Learning is less applicable to pedagogical - that is knowledge in action - development but is useful for modelling content or domain subject knowledge.
6.  Dreyfus and Dreyfus offer a Heuristic Model that can be applied to teacher development the stages are
    1.  Novice - learn and use context-free rules, learn definitions and procedures, work on rational, inflexible in application, conform to norms
    2.  Advanced Beginner - likely 2nd, 3rd, 4th year teachers, experience melds with verbal knowledge, episodic and case knowledge is building - assists with handling similarity across contexts - conditional and strategic knowledge is built - when to ignore/bend/break rules, practical knowledge is built, action oriented, practical knowledge is built without need for others - reflection and building is important. Situated knowledge is built and this is often tacit or implicit - which means that experienced teachers find it hard to tell others about or articulate practical knowledge.
    3.  Competent - Once the teacher develops wilful agency - not all advanced beginners reach this stage, evidence exists that some teachers will remain as less than competent level - See Borko 1992, Eisenhart and Jones 1992, make conscious choices - set priorities, decide on plans, rational goals, choose sensible means to achieve aims, while enacting they can decide what is and what is not important - when to stay with a topic and when to move on. this is the level at which teachers stop making timing errors and stop making targetting errors where they pick on wrong children to ask or identify trouble-makers incorrectly. From experience they know what to focus on and what to leave out. Not yet fast and fluid , they feel more responsible for what happens
    4.  Proficient - Reached by a small number of teachers after 5 years, still analytic and deliberate, intuition and know how, holistic view starts to emerge recognising similarity between event that novices miss, may start to predict events and outcomes
    5.  and Expert - fluid performance, not consciously deciding, non deliberative ways, these teachers sense in a non analytic way
        1.  Look at Shon 1983 for expert teachers - knowledge in action
        2.  Look at Polya 1954 for role of tacit knowledge in problem solving
        3.  Look at Hammerness, Darling-Hammond, and Shulman 2002, AND Sullivan, Vogler, Coleman and Jones 2002 - For use of Dreyfus and Dreyfus heuristic method
7.  2 problems in studying exeprt pedagogy
    1.  Its harder to identify expert teachers compared with other professions - objective criteria has been developed by Bond, Smith, Baker and Hattie 2000. This has been used in the National Board for Professional Teacher Standards (NBPTS) 1994
    2.  It is difficut to document links between expertise and student achievement 
        1.  some teachers never get past Advanced beginner
        2.  Proficient and Expert are hard to distinguish
8.  In Bond's study (2000) There are 13 characteristics of expert teachers - coders were trained at rating these effectively - study found that there was a correlation between the certified teachers from the NBPTS  and student acheivement. certified teachers also rated higher in these 13 than non-certified but experienced teachers.
    1.  better use of knowledge
    2.  \*extensive pedagogical content knowledge including deep representations of subject matter knowledge
    3.  better problem solving strategies
    4.  better adaptation and modification of goals for diverse learners and better skills for improvisation
    5.  better decision making
    6.  \*more challenging objectives
    7.  better classroom climate
    8.  better perception of classroom events and better ability to read the cues from students
    9.  greater sensitivity to context
    10.  \*better monitoring of learning and providing feedback to students
    11.  more frequent teaching of hypotheses
    12.  greater respect for students and 
    13.  display more passion for teaching

\* above are the biggest discriminators for expert vs non-expert teachers.
