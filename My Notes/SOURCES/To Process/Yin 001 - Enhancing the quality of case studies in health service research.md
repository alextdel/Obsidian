# Yin 001 - Enhancing the quality of case studies in health service research


1.  Ethical - Confidentiality, Informed Consent, What ethical tensions
2.  Methodological - How, Data Collection, Flexibility, How to provide rich accurate picture
    1.  Case study is not 'theory driven' but rather 'driven to theory'  p.1212
3.  Sampling and Selection - Choosing case, how many, + and - of limiting sample to cases
    1.  Yin tells us that using sampling criteria to select cases leads to trouble that is difficult to overcome. unless a case is very 'well endowed' and is permitted over an extensive period of time for completion, the number of cases will always be insufficient to satisfy the sampling strategy . Rather each case should be considered a seperate sub-inquiry.
    2.  To develop generalisation the case should give rise to theory that then is considered substantial enough to suggest replication in other cases. "a theory about what is being studied-and about whether a single case is a "critical" exemplar of that theory
        or about why some multiple cases might be expected to be replications and
        others might not-is essential to case study design and analysis"p 1213.
        
4.  Analysis - Typical Analytical Methods, advantages and disadvantages
    
5.  Validity and Trustworthiness - relate issues of validity and trustworthiness to the philosophical background
    1.  Generalisation from case study research is considered a major shortcoming of the method p. 1212
6.  Accurate Quote - "paste here" - p XX
