# Smythe and Murray 002 - Owning the Story: Ethical Considerations in Narrative Research


1.  Traditional Ethical Principles include:
    1.  Free and informed consent - researchers are obliged to reach agreement with the participants and not just "having a consent form signed" p. 313
        *   Free consent means that individuals consent voluntarily and are not induced to do so using any undue form of influence or coercion.
            
        *   Informed consent means the researchers provide full and frank disclosure of all information relevant to free and informed consent. It is not necessary to include full details of the research but all aspects that may affect their decision to participate should be disclosed.
            *   included the purpose of the research, identity of the researcher, duration of participation, nature of research procedures, any foreseeable risks or benefits, assurance that the participant may withdraw from participation freely and voluntarily
    2.  Privacy and Confidentiality
        *   it is the right of individuals not to have personal and identifying information about them disclosed without their permission.
        *   Confidentiality and anonymity are the means by  which researchers protect their participants' rights to privacy.
        *   Privacy does not override factors such as child abuse, homicidal intent, sexually transmitted diseases etc.
    3.  Protection from Harm
        *   Researchers take all reasonable steps to avoid harming their research participants. Minimum risk is considered to be that which would occur by virtue of a participants normal activity.
    4.  Avoidance of conflict of interest
        *   researchers should not exploit any relationship with participants of research to further personal , political or business interests at the expense of the best interests of their research participants. 
        *   this can often occur where a researcher has other relationships with the participant apart from those of researcher and participant.
        *   where conflict of interest is unavoidable it is important to disclose them fully as a condition of 'informed consent'
    5.  Avoidance of Deception
        *   Use of deception is ethically problematic as it undermines the principle of free and informed consent.
            
    6.  Providing Information and Debriefing
        *   Research participants have the right to receive in a timely manner appropriate information about the nature, results and conclusions of the research.
        *   In some cases the researcher may also give the participant the choice to withdraw from the study as a result of seeing the results of the study.
