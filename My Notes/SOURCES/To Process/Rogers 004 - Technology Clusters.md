# Rogers 004 - Technology Clusters


1.  A technology cluster is a set of distinguishable elements of technology that are closely interrelated.

*    For example recycle paper, recycle cartons, recycle  cans are a cluster of technologies
*   Some change agents advocate for a package of innovations because the innovations are adopted quicker.
*   A cluster of innovations or technologies was introduced when the Green Revolution was taking place, so-called miracle varieties of rice and wheat, chemical fertilisers, pesticides and planting techniques were advocated. A farmer who used the whole cluster of innovations could see increase yields by a factor of 3.
*   Older DoI research treated each innovation as seperate with the assumption that the experience with one innovation effects the individual's perception of the following innovations - however this is an oversimplification as the experience that individuals have with closely placed innovations is interrelated. Roger's calls for more scholarly attention to be paid to technology clusters. See Wicked 

1.  Method Note
2.  Paradigm Note
3.  Accurate Quote - "While it is much simpler for diffusion scholars to investigate the spread of each innovation as a n independent event, this is a distortion of reality. More scholarly attention should be paid to technology clusters." - p13
