# Dobson 001 - Longitudinal Case Research: A Critical Realist Perspective


1.  Case studies can be classified as either _describing_ or _explaining_ a particular research phenomenon. Researcher should consider which they want to do as:
    1.  explanation suggests a realist approach and 
    2.  description suggests an interpretive approach. 

3.  Case studies look at phenomena in real life contexts
4.  Especially when the boundaries between the phenomenon and the context are not clearly evident p. 283.
5.  Dobson tells us that Yin (1994, p 13 Case Study Research: Design and Methods, 2nd ed., Sage, Thousand Oaks, CA.) proposes a generally positivist approach to case research.
    
6.  Dobson tells us that Stake (1994 -Case studies. In Denzin, N. K., and Lincoln, Y. S. (eds.), Handbook of Quali- tative Research, Sage, Thousand Oaks, CA.) describes 2 types of case study
    1.  intrinsic case study - interesting in its own right and not done because the case is representative. The case is interesting in all its peculiarities. Is not done to come to a general understanding
    2.  instrumental case study - attempts to provide insight into and issue or refinement of theory. Case is of secondary interest and merely supports our understanding of something else.
7.  Dobson refers to  Stake (1994), Darke et al (1998), Craib (1992). These support similar categorisations  (i) into intrinsic and instrumental case study (Stake) or (ii) that the purposes of case study are to describe phenomena, develop theory or test theory (Darke et al), or (iii) similarly that the purposes are to _describe_ or _explain_ .
8.  Craib argues for the importance of explanation (instrumental) in comparison to description as descriptive work is being emphasised due to a growing scepticism of the possibility of explanation or of 'totalising theory' being possible.
9.  Schaller and Tobin (in press) argue the importance of description
10.  postmodern perspectives indicate that description is all we can hope for, Dobson gives the quote “all interpretations of phenomena are equally valid, and the world is so complicated that concepts such as prediction and causality are irrelevant. Everything is related to every- thing else so the search for causes or origins must be discontinued” (Kilduff and Mehra, 1997, p. 456).
11.  Dobson tells us that 
    1.  This issue concerning whether case research should aim at explanation or description concerns ontological issues regarding the research object. The requirement for explanation suggests that there is an underlying truth that is amenable to explanation and suggests a realist stance on the part of the researcher. The researcher’s stance on explanation or description is a fundamental issue that needs to be addressed early on in the research process as it affects all later decisions on the development of the research. p. 284
