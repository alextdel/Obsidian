# Gibbert et al 001 - What passes as a rigorous Case Study?


1.  Ethical - Confidentiality, Informed Consent, What ethical tensions
2.  Methodological - How, Data Collection, Flexibility, How to provide rich accurate picture
    1.  Givvert et al. tell us that case study is useful especially in the initial phases of generating theory  - the field of their interest is in management - however they state difficulties in lack of rigor and that this causes problems for two reasons. 1st because they tend to be used in the early phases of theory generation, any problems of rigor would have ripple effects throughout the later stages of research when relationships between variables are elaborated and tested (note to self - this is a postpositivistic approach). 2nd because case studies are used in management studies they are expected to be relevant, but without rigor the relevance in management research cannot be claimed. p. 1465
3.  Sampling and Selection - Choosing case, how many, + and - of limiting sample to cases
4.  Analysis - Typical Analytical Methods, advantages and disadvantages
    
5.  Validity and Trustworthiness - relate issues of validity and trustworthiness to the philosophical background
    1.  Reliability is aided by a well designed database of case study findings that contains all documents, interview transcripts, archival data etc. p. 1467
6.  Accurate Quote - "‘Reliability’ refers to the absence of random error, enabling subsequent researchers to arrive at the same insights if they conduct the study along the same steps again (Denzin and Lincoln, 1994). The key words here are transparency and replication. Transparency can be enhanced through measures such as careful documentation and clariﬁcation of the research procedures, for example, by producing a case study protocol—a report that speciﬁes how the entire case study has been conducted. Replication may be accomplished by putting together a case study database, which should include the case study notes, the case study documents, and the narratives collected during the study, organized in such a way as to facilitate retrieval for later investigators (Yin, 1994), that is, to facilitate the replication of the case study (e.g., Leonard-Barton, 1990)." - p 1468
