# Adelman et al 001 - Rethinking Case Study: notes from the second Cambridge Conference


1.  Ethical - Confidentiality, Informed Consent, What ethical tensions
    *   Because case studies are often 'close up' accounts, it may be necessary to re-adjust the balance of power between the research community and those studied: one way of making salient the rights of those studied may be through a more explicit 'research contract'. Rele-vant questions include: 
        *   (a) The credentials of the research team. Can they show ex- amples of their previous work? Do they supply references?
2.  Methodological - How, Data Collection, Flexibility, How to provide rich accurate picture
3.  Sampling and Selection - Choosing case, how many, + and - of limiting sample to cases
4.  Analysis - Typical Analytical Methods, advantages and disadvantages
    
5.  Validity and Trustworthiness - relate issues of validity and trustworthiness to the philosophical background
6.  Accurate Quote - "paste here" - p XX
