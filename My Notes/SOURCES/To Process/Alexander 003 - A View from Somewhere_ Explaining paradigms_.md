# Alexander 003 - A View from Somewhere: Explaining paradigms ...


1.  Note - Thomas Kuhn's notion of the scientific paradigm is that there is a Qualitative Paradigm that is as valid as the Quantitative Paradigm. That is, as intellectually legitimate. Alexander calls this the dual (or plural) epistemology thesis and sees that this thesis has some flaws.
    1.  Because the two paradigms have their own assumptions, one cannot be criticised or judged on the basis of the other. Therefore it is impossible to refute elements of the paradigms without referring to the conditions and assumptions of the same paradigm as is being judged. Therefore any orientation that does not prize internal consistency cannot be held to account.
    2.  The dual epistemology discourages the use of mixed methods as the two are, again based on different underlying assumptions and purposes. Rather is encourages purism in epistemology and methodology.
    3.  According to Kuhn's scientific research paradigms a new paradigm cannot appear without questioning and challenging the previous paradigm, and indeed replacing it. Thus the dual epistemology thesis leaves the positivist paradigm unable to hold its place, it would be renegotiated or even replaced by the new paradigm.
    4.  The movement to qualitative forms of research asked searching questions about the assumptions and 'coherence' of positivist notions such as generalisable social laws, behavioural facts independent of political ideology or ethical values. Yet many dual-epistemology researchers use the positivist methods or watered down versions of them, to cross check some of the findings of the qualitative research. Thus epistemologically the qualitative methodology is treated as a lesser or weaker form of research. However, the constructivist, at their core, base their concept of knowledge in a completely different set of assumptions. In this way qualitative research hasn't yet worked out how to view positivist measures and the research that is based on these measures.
