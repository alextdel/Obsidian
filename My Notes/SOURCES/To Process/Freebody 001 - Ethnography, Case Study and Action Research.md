# Freebody 001 - Ethnography, Case Study and Action Research


1.  Ethical - Confidentiality, Informed Consent, What ethical tensions
2.  Methodological - How, Data Collection, Flexibility, How to provide rich accurate picture
    1.  Observation, interviews and site documents will likely be used in the study. Freebody tells us that the method of collection is not as important as a commitment to tell the story - p. 82
    2.  Define / design / collect data / analyse/ report
    3.  Important that the study has a willingness to change depending on findings p. 78
    4.  Triangulation of data sources is important p. 84
3.  Sampling and Selection - Choosing case, how many, + and - of limiting sample to cases
    1.  Methods are expedient, purposeful, probability - the study is likely to use purposeful selection of the case or cases to be used.
    2.  
4.  Analysis - Typical Analytical Methods, advantages and disadvantages
5.  Validity and Trustworthiness - relate issues of validity and trustworthiness to the philosophical background
    1.  Case study is likely to suffer from problems of replication, this is an issue of external validity. This can be improved by clarity and accuracy of representation of context, problem statement, data collection methods and assumptions.
    2.  For internal validity, triangulation is an important way to improve validity and trustworthiness
    3.  Look for disconfirming and anomalous data
    4.  Factors involved in the reliability and validity of ethnographic research in education include

*   researcher's familiarity with the site, the people and/or activities (Delamont et al., 2000) p. 77
*   the question of presentation and re-presentation in the ethnographic text
*   authorship
*   the authorship of the interpretations and the text, and the authority claimed by the writers (Knupfer, 1996)
*   One way of approaching these issues is to draw on Goetz and LeCompte's (1984) two types of reliability in ethnography

1.  1.  External reliability -  the extent to which independent researchs working in the same or similar context would obtain consistent results
    2.  Internal reliability - the extent to which researchers concerned with the same data and constructs would obtain consistent results
    
    *   Accurate Quote - "The fundamental ways to enhance reliability and validity are the same for ethnographic research as they are for any other kind - through 'ensuring the clarity and accuracy of the representations of: the context of the research; the statement of the problem to be investigated; the ways in which the researcher gained access to the data; the assumptiqns ofthe participants; and understandings on the site about the researcher's role as a researcher." - p77

2.  Method Note
3.  Paradigm Note
4.  Accurate Quote - "paste here" - p XX
