# Ben-Peretz - 003 - Teacher Knowledge: what is it? How do we uncover it? What are its implications?


This note looks at Ben-Peretz findings - see other notecards for the nature of teacher knowledge and how it develops and about how teacher knowledge is uncovered

1.  Views concerning teacher knowledge have implications for schooling and teacher education. Emphasizing the personal aspects of teachers' knowledge leads to a different understanding of teachers' classroom practice. 
2.  A socially-conscious approach requires teacher education programs that focus on societal issues.
3.  There is an apparent gap between scholarly frameworks and studies such as that set by university lecturers, and the realities of teacher practice as seen by student teachers and mentors. - Ben-Peretz comments that this is a call for attention by educators and policy makers.
