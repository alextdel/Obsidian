# Miller and Glassner 005 - The "inside" and the "outside": Finding realities in interviews


1.  Despite the fact that interviews cannot match the positivist ideal of finding the 'real' objective truth Miller and Glassner argue that "information about social worlds is achievable through in-depth interviewing"
2.  The language used in interviews causes displacement of the lived experience 
3.  the language of interviews fractures the stories being told. The narrative must be partial, finite in length. The research itself fractures the stories. The coding, categorisation and typologising of stories results in telling only parts of stories p. 127.
4.  Because the way an interviewer relates to an interviewee can change the story being told and how the story is heard - based on the interviewers cultural and historical background, there can be a significant issue with reliability of the story being told and heard if the interviewer does not share membership of the same group as the interviewees.
5.  Paradigm Note
    
6.  Accurate Quote -
