    1.  Reliability is concerned with the replicability of scientific findings,
        1.  External **reliability** addresses the issue of whether independent researchers would discover the same phenomena or generate the same constructs in the same or similar settings.
        2.  Internal **reliability** refers to the degree to which other researchers, given a set of previously generated constructs, would match them with data in the same way as did the original researcher
    2.  Validity is concerned with the accuracy of scientific findings
        1.  External **validity** addresses the degree to which such representations may be compared legitimately across groups.
        2.  Internal **validity** refers to the extent to which scientific observations and measurements are authentic representations of some reality.
