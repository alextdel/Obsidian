**Note**
The following gives an account of the move from Vygotsky’s work where the unit of analysis was the person and their environment, to the Kharkovite scholars move to formalize Activity Theory as the study of activity as a holistic unit of analysis driven by motives and goals, to Engestrom’s work on Activity System’s Analysis where the unit of analysis is still centred around object-oriented activities but where the subject may be an individual, group or even an organization

Working with multiple translations of the same work may make it difficult for non-Russian speaking researchers and practitioners to comfortably cite the original sources. For this reason, it is important for researchers to clearly articulate in their work which version of a translated text they are citing, and, if possible, acknowledge that there are different interpretations to some of the CHAT concepts and clarify which interpretation the researcher chose to use in their work.

Vygotsky was one of several post-revolution scholars who was asked by the new government to reformulate psychology, incorporating Marxist philosophical principles (Wertsch 1985a). During this time, many psychologists could not reach a

Following the charge set forth to him by the government, Vygotsky based his psychology on Marxian theory to describe the relationship between individuals and their social environment (Cole 1985; Wertsch 1985b). He used Marx’s political

Through this reformulation of psychology, Vygotsky attempted to capture the co-evolutionary process individuals encounter in their environment while learning to engage in shared activities (Stetsenko 2005).

In reaction to Pavlov’s work, some Russian psychologists began to separate themselves from other scientific fields that relied on associationism. They began to define psychology as a science that treated the organism and the environment as two disembodied entities that were connected through stimulus and response relationships (Scribner 1997). Associationism brought many psychologists an opportunity to shed the pseudo-science label with which it had been burdened. They

Vygotsky did not agree with the mainstream movement toward transforming psychology into a scientific field by separating the organism and the environment. He argued that psychologists needed to develop a unified framework that supported objective study of human consciousness (Galperin 1992; Luria 1979). In this unified framework, the organism and the environment were parts of a complex system that co-created consciousness through human participation in activities (Vygotsky 1978). He was interested in identifying methods that would objectively study and explain human activities.

Vygotsky took an approach in psychology that recognized the essential relationship between an individual’s mental processes and that individual’s interaction with cultural, historical, and institutional settings (Rogoff 1990; Wertsch 1991; Wertsch et al. 1995). He believed that psychology ought to become a scientific field that

The interactions in which individuals engage allow opportunities for mediated action that contribute to the social formation of their consciousness (Wertsch 1985b) In this interaction, individuals are not passive participants waiting for the environment to instigate meaning-making processes for them, but, through their interactions, individuals make meaning of the world while they modify and create activities that trigger transformations of artifacts, tools, and people in their environment (Scribner 1997).

Note: Relating to teaching. The semiotic nature of tacit knowledge, as possessed by expert teachers, is a product of the teacher's experience of the activity of teaching. Thus, the tacit knowledge is a mediating artefact, being both a product and tool of the activity of teaching.

Signs do not have concrete physical existence in the environment, but they serve as a byproduct of the interaction between individuals and artifacts/tools to mediate thought processes (Vygotsky 1978).

Highlight
Signs are not represented in the basic triangle, but are assumed to be an artifact of the mediated action process. This triangular representation of mediated action was Vygotsky’s attempt to explain human consciousness development in a manner that did not rely on dualistic stimulus–response associations. Human activity is a process that involves artifacts that act as technical tools and signs that act as psychological tools available in the social environment (Wertsch et al. 1993), and this process contributes to the formation of individual consciousness within an evolving environment.

Note: Based on the behaviourist principles of Pavlov, some psychologists looked to 'associationism' which relies on the separation of the organism and the environment. Vygotsky did not agree with this way of conceptualising the relationship between humans and their environment. However some of his work is ambiguous on the internal-external question as he uses the idea of internalisations which infers an external/internal dualism (separation of mind and physical being).

Highlight
Mediated action is viewed as a means of interpersonal communication through the interactions among subject, tool, sign, and object while the subject develops new signs that help them make meaning of the world (Kozulin 1996). Once a sign materializes, the subject can transform the sign into an artifact or a cultural tool by the way in which s/he decides to continue to use and share the sign.

The Russian word “object” has multiple meanings when translated into English. It has been used interchangeably to refer to the goal of an activity, the motives for participating in an activity, and material products that participants try to gain through an activity. This has created confusion among CHAT scholars regarding what object-oriented activity means (Nardi 2005). What CHAT scholars do agree about is that the “object” is the reason why individuals and groups of individuals choose to participate in an activity (Kaptelinin 2005), and it is what holds together the elements in an activity (Hyysalo 2005).

Highlight
Vygotsky has been criticized for introducing internalization to CHAT because it is based on a dualistic language, which is contradictory to how he explained mediated action and it can over simplify mediated action into an input and output process.

Highlight
Vygotsky’s efforts to reconcile the disembodied treatment of the organism and the environment may have been a bold attempt in the 1920s and 1930s, but his arguments themselves were not free from binding dualistic language. Current researchers and practitioners need to be aware of this and be honest about how CHAT as a field has not eliminated dualistic language in its theory development and we are still working to identify how to better explain human activity with a nondualist framework. For example, Galperin on numerous occasions has vehemently argued that, despite Vygotsky’s attempts to rid the divide between the organism and its environment, “the external remained external, and the internal remained internal” (Galperin 1992). Furthermore, by using internalization as a theoretical concept within CHAT, Vygotsky overemphasized the transformations that individuals experienced and did not sufficiently address the individual’s influence on the transformations of the social environment (Matusov 1998). As a result, a criticism of the Vygotskian method of CHAT analysis of human activity is that it became too person-centered and did not adequately address cultural evolutions.

By using the ZPD as a metaphor, Vygotsky attempted to eliminate the unidirectional relationship he himself created between the organism and the environment in his internalization process. The ZPD is where the interpersonal and intrapersonal activities blend and fuse and no longer exist as different entities. Vygotsky was attempting to move away from viewing individual consciousness as a commodity that grew within an individual; instead he viewed it as a shared embodiment between individuals and their environments, including social others.

Following Vygotsky’s death … Due to political  pressures and fear of maintaining their careers and lives, the Kharkovites (a school of developmental psychology set up by Luria and Leontiev in the town of Kharkov) purposefully shifted the focus of their work on human activity as a topic of study in psychology to be better accepted by the Soviet government.

Highlight
Activity theory was originally developed during the early twentieth century by S.L. Rubinshtein, independent of Vygotsky’s work, as a philosophical and psychological theory (Brushlinskii 2004). The Kharkovites extended Rubinshtein’s work by focusing on the psychological aspects and treating activity as a holistic unit of analysis directed by an individual or groups of individuals’ goals and motives for participating in an activity (Davydov 1999; Galperin 1992; Leontiev 1974).

**■** _Page 8:_
Highlight
Vygotsky’s mediated action is often explained as a process, but human activity from an activity theory perspective is a series of processes that is contained within an activity that acts as a bounded system.

Galperin introduced the concept of “orienting activity” (Stetsenko and Arievitch 1997). Galperin (1989) explains mental activity as the ability that allows human beings to explore, examine, and predict potential results of actions they were preparing to initiate.

Hence, mental activity itself does not exist separate from observable physical action, but is part of the psychological content of an action and serves the purpose of a sign in mediated action. Indeed, psychologists can examine the psychological and physical actions separately, but by doing so they fail to encapsulate the complex nature of activity in its psychological and physical entirety. Post-Vygotskian researchers attempted to overcome the problems brought upon by the internalization metaphor by identifying the unit of analysis in activity theory as human activity itself, which inherently included both mental activity and observable activity.

In a lecture for a child psychology course at Moscow State University, D.B. El’konin, cited in El’konin (1993), made note of this relationship between meaning (mental activity), behavior (external activity), and the subject:
Human action with objects has two aspects. It contains human meaning as well as an operation aspect. If you omit meaning, it ceases to be an action, but if you void it of the operational and practical aspect, then too, nothing remains of it… Thus, these two aspects already exist within the unit of human behavior, and that unit of human behavior is a purposeful, conscious action. Moreover, these must be seen as two aspects as well, not as different spheres of the world having nothing to do with one another (p. 23).

Leontiev identified object-oriented activity as the unit of analysis that activity theorists are interested in examining. Object-oriented activity involves interaction among subject, object, motivation, action, goals, socio-historical context, and the consequences and activity (Davydov 1999; Galperin 1992; Lazarev 2004).
Leontiev (1974)1 defined object-oriented activity as:
 …a molar and nonadditive unit of a material subject’s life. In a narrower and more psycho- logical sense, activity is a unit of life mediated by mental reflection whose real function is to orient the subject to the world of objects. Activity is thus not a reaction or a totality of reactions, but rather a system possessing structure, inner transformations, conversations, and development (p. 10).

Highlight
Leontiev provided a clear distinction between object-oriented activity and goal-directed actions. Goal-directed actions are much more temporary in nature and may be a step that subjects take in the process of participating in an object-oriented activity. Goal-directed actions often are individually focused and have less of a collective consequence to the community-based object-oriented activity (Leontiev 1974), and may be a means for individuals or groups of individuals to participate in the object-oriented activity.
Note:
This relates to the hunting example …

Engeström (1987) further developed analytical methods within activity theory by introducing activity systems analysis. Activity systems analysis is used to map the co-evolutionary interaction between individuals or groups of individuals and the environment, and how they affect one another. It extends mediated action as a model of human activity that accounts for sociopolitical situations (Cole 1996). It specifically addresses both the individual and the environment in order to move away from former CHAT methods that were too person-focused.

**■** _Page 10:_
Highlight
The unit of analysis in activity systems analysis is the object-oriented activity itself (Engeström 1987; Rogoff 1995; Wertsch 1991; Wertsch et al. 1995).

Highlight
Human activity can trigger tensions caused by systemic contradictions (Cole and Engeström 1993; Engeström 1987, 1993). These tensions arise when the conditions of an activity put the subject in contradictory situations that can preclude achieving the object or the nature of the subject’s participation in the activity while trying to achieve the object. In some cases, the activity may collapse altogether and the sub- ject may not be able to attain the object. In other cases, subjects may attain the object but be dissatisfied about how they attained the object.
