# Andrade 001 - Interpretive research aimed at theory building: Adopting and adapting the case study design


1.  Ethical - Confidentiality, Informed Consent, What ethical tensions
2.  Methodological - How, Data Collection, Flexibility, How to provide rich accurate picture
3.  Sampling and Selection - Choosing case, how many, + and - of limiting sample to cases
4.  Analysis - Typical Analytical Methods, advantages and disadvantages
    
5.  Validity and Trustworthiness - relate issues of validity and trustworthiness to the philosophical background
    1.  External validity is establishing the domain to which a studies findings can be generalised - in single case studies this is done by using theory, in multi-case studies replication logic is used
    2.  Reliability - this is demonstrating that a study can be repeated with the same results - in case study use case study protocol and develop case study database.
    3.  Internal validity - this is establishing causal relationship as distinguished from spurious relationships - in case study this is done by pattern matching, explanation building, by addressing rival expectations and by using logic models
    4.  Construct validity - establishing correct operational measures for the concepts being studied - in case studies this is done by using multiple sources of evidence and by using member checking
6.  Accurate Quote - "paste here" - p XX
