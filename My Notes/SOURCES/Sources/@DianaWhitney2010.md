**Abstract:**
In a decade of using Appreciative Inquiry as a process for organizational change at Hunter Douglas and elsewhere, we have witnessed exciting transformations in the way people work together and in the results they achieve. And we have heard stories, over and over again, about the positive impact of Appreciative Inquiry on people’s personal and professional lives. So we began to ask ourselves and those with whom we have worked: What’s happening? Why do people get so excited and want to participate in Appreciative Inquiry? Why does participation so readily lead to innovation, productivity, employee satisfaction, and profitability? What is it that creates possibilities for personal transformation and for people to discover and be their best at work? What conditions foster cooperation throughout a whole system of highly diverse groups of people? In short, the central question of our reflection and the question addressed in this chapter is Why Does Appreciative Inquiry Work?
