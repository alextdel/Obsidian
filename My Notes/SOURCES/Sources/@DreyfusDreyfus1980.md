### Abstract:
In acquiring a skill by means of instruction and experience, the student normally passes through five developmental stages which we designate novice, competence, proficiency, expertise and mastery. We argue, based on analysis of careful descriptions of skill acquisition, that as the student becomes skilled, he depends less on abstract principles and more on concrete experience. We systematize and illustrate the progressive changes in a performer's ways of seeing his task environment. We conclude that any skilltraining procedure must be based on some model of skill acquisition, so that it can address, at each stage of training, the appropriate issues involved in facilitating advancement.

### Annotations and Notes:

([Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1980, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/XD5R9H7C)) This paper starts from the standpoint that many research results from experiments that are carried out in highly controlled situations where the investigation is not linked to a real context prove not to see their results reflected in real life. Factors such the knowledge of being observed and the move from highly contrived experimental conditions to concrete and real applications shows how unreliable the findings from strictly carried out research can be. As a result this investigation focuses on in-context experience during the development of skills.

#### Automatic and controlled processing
([Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1980, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/XD5R9H7C)) refer to the articles [[@SchneiderShiffrin1977]] and  [[@ShiffrinSchneider1977]] which discuss the difference between [[Automatic Processing]] and [[Controlled Processing]] . The controlled form required attention to a sequence of elements that are summoned temporarily (that is they are not a learned sequence) are usually performed in a linear series and are capacity-limited. In contrast, the automatic form involves the the activation (recall) of a learned routine or process which is initiated by appropriate conditions or inputs and then is enacted automatically without subject control and without significantly stressing the system's capacity, often without requiring attention. Repeated over time, the controlled process is found to become more automatic with less attention and effort required.
The key to improving performance is stated by ([Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1980, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/XD5R9H7C)) to be automation of routines so that [[Controlled Processing]] can occur at the same time as the [[Automatic Processing]]. This requires practice in similar scenarios.

#### Solving problems in everyday authentic contexts
([Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1980, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/XD5R9H7C)) Find that problem solving seems to occur more effectively when set in everyday, authentic contexts. This was illustrated by Wason (in [[@DreyfusDreyfus1980]] p.4) when he studied the logical problem solving of selecting items based on a logic problem. Wason found that participants operated far more effectively when the same type of problem was situated in scenarios familiar to the participant, such as in a work context.
Dreyfus and Dreyfus could not account for the fact that this seems contrary to the common supposition, as argued by Kohler (in [[@DreyfusDreyfus1980]] p.2) and Merleau-Ponty (also [[@DreyfusDreyfus1980]] p.2), that problems are abstracted from everyday contexts into some form of mental model comprised of lawlike combinations of elements and then solved.
Rather than treat this apparent contradiction as an anomy, Dreyfus and Dreyfus consider the reliance of problem solving proficiency on concrete everyday experience and context a core feature of improving proficiency ([Dreyfus and Dreyfus, 1980, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/XD5R9H7C)) .

#### [[Five Stage Models of development]]
The five stage model of the mental  activities involved in directed skill acquisition as described in [[@DreyfusDreyfus1980]], consists of the [[Novice Stage]], [[Competence Stage]], [[Proficiency Stage]], [[Expertise Stage]], [[Mastery Stage]].
