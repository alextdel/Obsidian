## Note

No note for today, just checking the Tiddalik Tasks were correct.

On this day I did a snapshot and install so I had a new staging.learn server for the learn.tiddalik.com.au site. See [[TDLK Learn Staging 04 Jan 2023]]

Tomorrow I will look at how to use Git to refresh the code base of Moodle.
See https://docs.moodle.org/38/en/Git_for_Administrators for the information I will use.
I will make a note here [[SPACES/LINUX & MOODLE TECH/Moodle Update using Git]]


I will also be installing Pop OS again on my main machine - Windows 11 is not my favourite



## Daily Reflection

#### How am I feeling?
- I haven't felt 100% today. I have a sore shoulder - like a crick in the neck but lower - probably a muscle pull.

#### What is in my mind?
- My mum's situation - she is in hospital and, I think, severely depressed.
- Getting used to thinking about future without CAC
