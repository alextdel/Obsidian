## Notes

Today
- [x] Deleted unuses staging server for TDLK
- [x] Added fresh server for Moodle
	- Added IP Address and server works
	- Next need to 
	- [ ] SSH certificate
	- [ ] git Moodle 
	- [ ] bring a  database dump across from the old DB
	- [ ] download / transfer extra plugins
	- [ ] run the Moodle installer
	- [ ] copy across custom CSS

Originally I thought about a fresh install with transfering the courses across but I think I will lose the  APP connectivity if I don't bring the whole database across.
