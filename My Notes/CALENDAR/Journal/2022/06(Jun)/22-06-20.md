## Note

I'm trying to work out what [[research areas]] to look at (see [[TASKS PERSONAL & TIDDALIK]] item)
- [[Expertise]]  ??
- [[Relationship of expertise to change]] ??
- Relationship of expertise to change in [[pedagogy]], [[leadership]], [[principal]] ??
- [[Teacher well-being]] ??

**Search on Eric*
1. Tried the [[search term]] "[[teacher expertise]]" since 2021, #peer_reviewed only - [see this search](https://eric.ed.gov/?q=%22teacher+expertise%22&pr=on&ff1=dtySince_2021)
	- Found there were 28 articles in [eric.ed.gov](https://eric.ed.gov), 

***Thoughts***
See [[Expertise MOC]], 

- Maybe I can research how the [[use of video]] of teachers' lessons using [[Thinking Routines]] can support beneficial changes in [[teacher expertise]] or more generally look at the effect of using set [[pedagogical protocols]] on [[teacher expertise]] or [[teacher confidence]].
- Can the use of [[Thinking Routines]] by teachers help with teachers developing more [[adaptive expertise]] and thereby cope (by being more [[adaptive]] or demonstrating more [[resilience]]) when factors in their classrooms change?
- Are teachers with more [[adaptive expertise]] more resilient to [[stressors]] and thereby suffer less [[stress]]?

A good start ...

## Daily Reflection

#### How am I feeling?
- Didn't feel very well this morning, did a RAT test (negative)
- Wasn't looking forward to the CPR workshop - lasted 1 1/2 hours.
- Spent too long doing a resource for #CoT for #Richard_Browning - but sent to him this afternoon.

#### What am I grateful for?
- Nice to be on holidays

#### What is in my mind?
- I want to stop fiddling with the Obsidian set up and get some notes written that I feel are of value.
