From 1995, IIER has been published jointly by Australia's Institutes for Educational Research in [New South Wales](http://www.nswier.org), [South Australia](http://saier.org.au/) and [Western Australia](http://www.waier.org.au/).

IIER's 2010 ranking in the Australian Research Council's _[Tiers for the Australian Ranking of Journals](http://www.arc.gov.au/era/tiers_ranking.htm)_ is "Tier B", although IIER declined to endorse the premises underlying the "Four tiers" [[see IIER Editorial 20(3)](http://www.iier.org.au/iier20/editorial20-3.html) for discussion].
