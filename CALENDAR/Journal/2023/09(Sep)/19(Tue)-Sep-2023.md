### PEMS Topic 6 To Do

***NOTE - awaiting feedback from Renee's CEO review stage ...***

#### Parl PDF

- [ ] Step 4 – Renee moved the images slightly
 - [ ] Parliamentarians claim for reimbursement of hire cars via a different claim type (not travel expenses) therefore we need to:
	 - [ ] remove reference to hire cars throughout the parliamentarian guide (**only**).
- [ ] Parliamentarians have a different set of ‘purpose of travel’ to staff. The parliamentarian PDF shows ‘Official’ which is not available to parliamentarians’ (see below):
	- [ ] Renee updated the 2nd Notes: to ***‘For multi-day ~~car hire and~~ parking expenses select both the first and last day of the range.’***
	- [ ] When actioning any SES/CEO feedback, this image needs to be updated to show ‘Purpose of Travel’ as ‘Parliamentary Duties’ rather than ‘Official’.

#### Staff PDF
 - [ ] Step 4 – Moved the images slightly
 - [ ] Step 5 – You changed this as I asked below, just had a small rethink on review.
	 - [ ] 1st section – Change opening sentence to ‘To assign a claim created on behalf of someone else to them for their review:’
        - [ ] Change opening sentence of 2nd second to ‘To submit your claim for certification:’.
