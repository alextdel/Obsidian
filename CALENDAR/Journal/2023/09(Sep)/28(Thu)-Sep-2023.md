- Step 4 – Moved the images slightly
- Step 5 – You changed this as I asked below, just had a small rethink on review.
    - 1st section – Change opening sentence to ‘To assign a claim created on behalf of someone else to them for their review:’
    - Change opening sentence of 2nd second to ‘To submit your claim for certification:’.
*Renees second notes*
- ***only parliamentarian changes***
*Lee's notes from CEO*
- Step 3, 1st bullet – remove ‘picker’ so sentence reads: ‘…information using the date selection and dropdown fields’
- Step 3, under Notes, 3rd bullet – replace ‘should be’ with ‘are’
- Step 5, 2nd para, 3rd bullet – remove full stop
- Step 5, 2nd para, 4th bullet – add full stop as it completes the sentence
- Step 5, 2nd last para – replace ‘dismiss’ with ‘close’
- Step 5, last para – replace ‘of’ with ‘following’ – i.e. ‘following verification.’
