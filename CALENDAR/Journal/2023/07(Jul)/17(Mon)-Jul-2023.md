## Notes

TDLK to do
- [ ] Topic 2 - finalise when PEMS changes have come through - 27 July
- [ ] Topic 2 - small changes
      Step 2 – ‘View the opened Budget Usage Details screen. The ~~budget usage details~~ screen displays the current financial year.’ Remove repeating words.
- [ ] Topic 3 - 
- Step 1 – ‘To see all travel expenses related to your role:’ change to ‘To see all travel expenses available to your role:’. We want to make it clear based on a user’s role as parliamentarian or staff member (with certain authorisations) they can see more expenses than a general staff member.
- Step 2 – We need to clearly ‘highlight’ the Claims ‘tab’, could start this Step with ‘Screen defaults to the Claims tab’. This is the biggest focus in this topic, the difference between the Claims and Transactions tabs. For context, most offices don’t realise there is another tab (Transactions) as the screen defaults to ‘Claims’.
- Step 3 –
	- Travel Services Provider~~s~~ - remove ‘s’
	- Remove comma’s at end of bullet points second para, leave full stop on last bullet (as it completes the full sentence)
	- Can we please change the screenshot to be in the same format as Claims screen on Page 1
	- Update Transactions status table as per video notes above
- Step 4 – Remove ‘To add additional columns, filter and sort the expenses in your overview and save…’ and only refer users to the ‘Add filters to dashboards topic’ for more info.
