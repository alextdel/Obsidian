### Map of Contents Description:
This is the MOC for Stage Models related to skill acquisition and expertise development.
Several frameworks describing how skill, knowledge and expertise are developed rely on stage models. In some cases they map to mental state models such as [[@DreyfusDreyfus1980]], some relate to professional growth stages such as the [AITSL Career Stages](https://www.aitsl.edu.au/standards/understand-the-teacher-standards) 
Some stage models are the basis for a range of variants and are applied in different context to that of the original model. For example, one of the core stage models by Dreyfus and Dreyfus [[@DreyfusDreyfus1980]] is used in a wide range of applications and in some cases has been modified.
