# 2012 Voogt et al - Technological pedagogical content knowledge - a review of the literature


1.  Mishra and Koehler didn't see TPCK as a development of PCK but as the development of understanding in 3 knowledge domains T, P, C and in the intersections between them TP, TC, PC and TPC
2.  In using M and K's framework, it seemed difficult to produce measurement instruments to look at using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) (p4)
3.  M and K added 'context' to the TPCK framework to enable the effective teaching with technology.
    1.  knowledge about students, the school, the available infrastructure, the environment. (my note - is this because the TPCK concept was lacking. The Context seems to be overly aggregated.)
4.  Niess saw TPCK as a development of PCK (2005)
5.  Pierson (2001) viewed TPCK as a new definition of teacher technology integration
6.  Method Note
7.  Paradigm Note
8.  Accurate Quote - "paste here" - p XX
