4.  Analysis - Typical Analytical Methods, advantages and disadvantages
    1.  two ways to analyse
        1.   - within case analysis - note it is possible to have multiple cases and do a 'within case' analysis as long as the intension is not to do a comparison p. 242
        2.  \- cross case analysis - here the intention is to compare the cases
    2.  The efficacy of analysis is related to sampling as we only analyse what we sample p. 241.

    1.  Experience is created in the social texts created by the researcher, what is described by Denzin and Lincoln as the representational crisis p. 238
