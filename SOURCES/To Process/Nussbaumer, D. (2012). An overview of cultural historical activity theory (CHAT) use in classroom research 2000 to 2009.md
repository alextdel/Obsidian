CHAT is a theoretical framework introduced to the West by Michael Cole (American Psychological Association 2006) and popularized by Yrjo Engeström (1987).

\* \* \*

First Generation

Instead of focusing on the direct impact of stimulus on response, Vygotsky (1978) devised a new approach: the concept of mediation, the ﬁrst generation of this theory. He maintained that human beings as agents react to and act upon mediating objects of the environment such as tools, signs, and instruments leading to an outcome.

\* \* \*

Leont’ev went beyond the individual to a collective activity by incorporating com- munity and division of labor into Vygotsky’s model making it more of a systems approach. Not only does this model account for the historical-cultural traditions and experiences but also for the cognitive rather than merely the physical process. Leont’ev added different levels, such as activity driven by motive, action guided by a conscious goal, and automatic operations inﬂuenced by conditions and tools (Center for Activity Theory and Developmental Work, n.d.)

\* \* \*

Second generation

The second generation of this theory is attributed to Engeström (1987). Taking into account inter-relationships between the individual and the community, history, context, and interaction of the situation and activity, he incorporated the ﬁrst generation of CHAT into his ideas.

\* \* \*

Third generation

Engeström (2001) further detailed activity systems to include networks of interacting systems to deal with tensions and contradictions that encourage collective learning through change. This latter model, known as third generation CHAT, Figure 4, may be seen as applying to large systems, evolving into institutions and organizations (Center for Activity Theory and Developmental Work, n.d.).

\* \* \*

An activity in CHAT, according to Van Oers (2001) is “any motivated and object-oriented human enterprise, having its roots in cultural history, and depending for its actual occurrence on speciﬁc goal-oriented actions” (712)

\* \* \*

Actions “can be portrayed as issuing from ... awareness of reasons” (Bakhurst 2007, 65). Environmental surroundings and past experiences inﬂuence the kinds of operations or a form of unconscious actions that are dependent upon conditions chosen by the subject to carry out an activity

\* \* \*

Operations are the mechanics of pursuing goals that describe what has to be done and are used to realize actions.

\* \* \*

Note - how does 'activity', 'action', and 'operation' apply to the process of developing teaching proficiency and expertise?

\* \* \*

CHAT is a descriptive tool "Qualitative studies are concerned with detailed description. Therefore it is no surprise that CHAT, a descriptive tool, provides consideration for relationships as well as the environment that influence teaching-learning activities."

Qualitative studies are concerned with detailed description. Therefore it is no surprise that CHAT, a descriptive tool, provides consideration for relationships as well as the environment that influence teaching-learning activities.

\* \* \*

Note - what is the unit of analysis to be used 'individual' or 'collective'. The individual may be the focus of the activity of attaining improved proficiency (the definition of the motive, object, goal etc will need considering) the collective may be the unit of analysis - this will effectively be looking at 'good teaching' rather than 'good teachers'

\* \* \*

Based on the limited number of articles found in the last decade that actually applied CHAT to K-12 research in terms of theoretical constructs, a clearly deﬁned unit of analysis, and described mediation to elucidate outcome in terms of internalization/externalization, implies it may be difﬁcult for researchers and practitioners to make personal sense of this theory. Although initially appearing straightforward, the complexity of the framework in application of CHAT can be perplexing to the uninitiated. In addition studies that use CHAT to validate research efforts without applying principles and constructs indicate a researcher’s lack of theoretical under- standing or a sense of uneasiness about its underpinning principles and practical application (Barab and Squire 2004; Yamagata-Lynch 2007). However, it would be unreasonable to dismiss CHAT, as it can be signiﬁcant in contributing to the under- standing of certain complex situational teaching and learning activities.

\* \* \*

CHAT is broad enough to accommodate a great variety of contexts with different approaches and instruments, In addition to analysis of activities; it can be adjusted to clarify educational issues. Not only can CHAT explain situations in terms of dynamic relationships but also reveal social resources as they inﬂuence changes in human endeavors and educational practice. CHAT provides an adaptable, “. .. integrative road map for educational research and practice” (Roth and Lee 2007, 188), that is ill advised to ignore.
