# Ben-Peretz - 001 - Teacher Knowledge: what is it? How do we uncover it? What are its implications?


This note looks at Ben-Peretz findings about the nature of teacher knowledge and how it develops - see other notecards for how teacher knowledge is uncovered.

Point 1's bullet points are in chronological order of the papers reviewed by Ben-Peretz.

1.  What is considered Teacher Knowledge has changed, and is looked at in different ways
    *   Knowledge of general pedagogical principles, subject matter, skills of subject matter **(Richert 1988)**
    *   Professional, general and personal idiosyncratic knowledge (**Tamir 1991)**
    *   Teacher's personal-practical knowledge developing over time in different contexts **(Connelly, Clandinin and He 1997)**
    *   Curriculum subject knowledge = transformation of student teachers' subject knowlege into tasks that promote learning **(Edwards and Ogden 1998)**
    *   Content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge are a range of knowledge types developed by teachers as they respond to their experiences and participation in the classroom and therefore undergo 'teacher change' **(Clarke and Hollingsworth 2002).**
    *   Ben-Peretz (author of this paper) comments that "Teacher knowledge has been extended from knowledge of subject matter, curriculum and pedagogical content knowledge, to include general themes like global issues and multiculturalism **_(p.10)_**.
        *   "What is it that teachers need to know if they are to help pupils make sense of the world in the early 21st \[C\]entury? **(Holden and Hicks 2007 p.13)** 
            *   Holden and Hicks paper is effectively a call for change in what we consider the requirements of teaching and teacher education. That is to go beyond the knowledge of subjects and subject related pedagogy to things like multiculturalism and global themes
    *   Knowledge as 'practical theory' - development of teacher knowledge is the change in the student-teachers' practical theory **(Buitink 2009)**
        *   categories of practical teacher theories are similar to Shulman's pedagogical knowledge of learners, context knowledge and knowledge of educational contexts 
        *   importance is placed on field experiences - similar to **Tang's** (see below) focus.
        *   similar also to Clark and Hollingsworth's connection between teacher action and teacher knowledge.
2.  How Teacher Knowledge develops is also considered in the papers that Ben-Peretz reviews.
    *   Development of teacher knowledge is impacted by context - the action context, the socio-professional context, and the supervisory context. That is teachers throughout their development are influenced by their own actions, their personal relations at school, and the feedback from supervisors **(Tang (2003)**
        *   Tang talks of the conflict of "challenge and support", "tension and equilibrium", and "dissonance and resonance" - these have implications for the study of teachers' knowledge

2.  Method Note
    *   **This paper looks at the subject of teacher knowledge over a 20 year period. It** **is an editorial comparison looking at several papers on the subject of teacher knowledge from one journal - "Teaching and Teacher Education"**
3.  Paradigm Note
4.  Accurate Quote - "The closer we come to the present time, the more demands are made on the knowledge required by teachers" - p. 10
