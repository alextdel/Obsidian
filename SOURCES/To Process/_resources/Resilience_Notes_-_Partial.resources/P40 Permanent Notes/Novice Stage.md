### Note:
At this stage, a novice learns to recognise  '[[non-situational features]]’ (often just referred to as 'features') which a beginner can recognise without benefit of experience[[@DreyfusDreyfus1980]].  ‘[[Rules]]’ are developed or learned for dealing with each of these features. A novice's improvement in their performance is measured by relating the novice's actions to being in conformity with the rules.
