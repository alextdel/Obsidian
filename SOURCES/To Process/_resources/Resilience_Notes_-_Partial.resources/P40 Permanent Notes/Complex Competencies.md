### Note:
Sandra Milligan's work on complex competencies is informative in the modern era when the way we consider qualifications and skillls for life and particularly tertiary pathways needs to consider more than academic results. Her podcase [[Align Learning for Complex Competencies]] is informative.

More information is available here at the [Melbourne Graduate School of Education]([Assessment and Recognition of Complex Competencies (unimelb.edu.au)](https://education.unimelb.edu.au/arc/research/research-themes/assessment-and-recognition-of-complex-competencies))

See here for one of Sandra Milligan's 2019 conference presentations on [[Assessing Complex Competencies.pdf]].

And here for a comprehensive treatment of assessing general capabilities and other forms of complex competencies. [[Future Proofing Students.pdf]]

### Quotes:
"In the face of changing labour markets across the globe, the mastery of such skills as collaboration, creativity, critical thinking and communication is increasingly becoming the focus of education systems to ensure that learning is relevant and that students of all ages are well prepared for the future of work. To succeed in disruptive, rapidly changing, global and technology-rich information economies, proficiency in these and other complex competencies such as enterprise skills and intercultural understanding is required."
