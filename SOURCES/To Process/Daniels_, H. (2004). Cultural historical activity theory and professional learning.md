Each of these agencies has their own culture and histories that are relayed in attitudes, values, and priorities for action that often appear to be only partially compatible.

\* \* \*

My approach to the analysis of teaching and learning is predi- cated on the belief that the possibilities for human action and development are shaped by social, cultural, and historical factors.

\* \* \*

Note:

Daniels was looking for a methodology that considered the range of factors, such as psychological, social and cultural, in the way that special provisions were delivered and determined

\* \* \*

Note :

Check Daniels 1993, 1996, 2001 for any valuable ideas regarding Vygotsky

\* \* \*

There is a need to know much more about the relationship between socially available and personally accessible tools and signs and cogni- tive development. Equally there is a need to understand much more about relationships between organisational structures and processes, pedagogical processes, and individual functioning.

\* \* \*

Activity theorists seek to analyse the development of consciousness within practical social activity settings. Their emphasis is on the psycho- logical impacts of organised activity and the social conditions and systems which are produced in and through such activity

\* \* \*

Engestro¨m (1999) sees joint activity or practice as the unit of analysis for activity theory, not individual activity.

\* \* \*

instability (internal tensions) and contradiction as the “motive force of change and development” (p. 9) and the transitions and reorganisations within and between activity systems as part of evolution; it is not only the participant(s), but also the environment, that is modiﬁed through mediated activity.

\* \* \*

The so-called third generation of activity theory as proposed by Engestro¨m is intended to develop conceptual tools to understand dialogues, multiple perspectives, and networks of interacting activity systems (personal communi- cation, January 2004)

\* \* \*

He draws on ideas of “dialogicality” (the formation of ideas in dialogue) and multivoicedness (a recognition that actions and ideas are in- formed by many voices) in order to expand the framework of the second generation.

\* \* \*

The central thesis of the Russian cultural-historical school is that the structure and development of human psychological processes emerge through culturally mediated, historically developing, practical activity.

\* \* \*

By expansive learning we mean the capacity to interpret and expand the deﬁnition of the object of activity and respond in increasingly enriched ways

\* \* \*

Objects, such as these trajectories, should not be confused with goals. Goals are primarily conscious, relatively short-lived and ﬁnite aims of individual actions. The object is the constantly reproduced purpose of a collective activity system that motivates and deﬁnes the horizon of possible goals and actions (Engestro¨m, 1995; Leont’ev, 1978).

\* \* \*

Expansive learning involves the creation of new knowledge and new practices for a newly emerging activity; that is, learning embedded in and constitutive of qualitative transform- ation of the entire activity system. Such a transformation may be triggered by the introduction of a new technology or set of regulations, but it is not reducible to it

\* \* \*

Note :

Expansive learning is a specific type of learning that is associated with the creation of new knowledge. effectively the activity system is transformed. expansive learning is not the same a the learning which happens when existing knowledge is applied by a member of the social group involved, such as in the case of apprentices.

\* \* \*

Victor and Boynton (1998) argue that what craft workers know about products and processes rests in their personal intuition and experience with the customer, the product, the process, and the use of their tools. When they invent solutions, they create tacit knowledge that is tightly coupled with experience, technique, and tools. This is the kind of knowledge that teachers who regard themselves as “intuitive” would develop and use.

\* \* \*

Note:

Victor and Boynton identify 5 types of work in the history of industrial production: craft - mass production - process enhancement - mass customisation - and co-configuration. Each type generates and requires a certain type of knowledge and learning.

\* \* \*

Note:

Craft workers produce tacit knowledge through their interactions with the tasks that they are involved in - mass production codifies the tacit knowledge into 'best practice' routine that can be followed - mass production workers take this knowledge and further modified it by developing practical knowledge which incorporated what works and what doesn't work. a way to leverage this mass production-based practical knowledge is called 'linking'. linking is where the encouragement of sharing of practical knowledge assists in improving the overall output. Victor and Boynton call this process enhancement.

\* \* \*

The new knowledge generated by doing process enhancement work is leveraged and put into action as the organisation transforms its work to mass customisation

\* \* \*

Note:

mass customisation is the next step after 'process enhancement'

\* \* \*

Note:

The Victor and Boynton model shows again how Experts and highly proficient teachers seem not to fit the model. Experts and Highly Proficient teachers have tacit knowledge which is hard to codify except by simplifying. These skills are then taught to teachers as rules or processes. The teachers then have to turn the codified ' mass production' processes into their own 'practical knowledge' - which in time may transform to their own tacit knowldge. The process enhancement that happens when teachers share their practical knowledge does happen, but again, can the truly tacit be shared? Differentiated curriculum concepts are the equivalent to the mass customisation concept - this has obvious limits in the same way that the curriculum example given in this text explains.

\* \* \*

Note :

Doing 'mass customisation' requires designing a product at least once for each customer.. The firm or school creates a product that can learn and adapt, but also build an ongoing relationship between each customer-product pair and the company. Note: This is what schools say they do ... don't they?

\* \* \*

In such practices of co-conﬁguration there is a need to go beyond conventional teamwork or networking to the practice of knotworking (Engestro¨m, Engestro¨m, & Va¨ha¨aho, 1999). Knotworking is a rapidly changing, distributed and partially improvised orchestration of collaborative performance which takes place between otherwise loosely connected actors and their work systems to support clients. In knotworking, various forms of tying and untying of otherwise separate threads of activity takes place.

\* \* \*

Note

worth noting for expertise - tag

‘Expertise in such contexts is best understood as the collaborative and discursiveconstruction of tasks, solutions, visions, breakdowns, and innovations. In suchsituations professionals would discuss and negotiate priorities across the remitof their “home” agencies’

\* \* \*

In this expansive learning cycle we will work through the following steps as proposed and developed by Engestro¨m (1999).

1\. Drawing on ethnographic evidence to question existing practices.

2\. Analysing the historical origins of existing practices and bringing these analyses to bear in analysing current dynamics within and across services.

3\. Modelling an alternative way of working using the evidence collected in Step 2.

4\. Examining the model to understand its dynamics, strengths, and pitfalls.

5\. Implementing the model and monitoring the processes and impact of implementation in the dispositions and actions of professionals.

6\. Drawing on these data to reﬂect on the processes and outcomes.

The expansive learning cycle ensures regular feedback to participants through their engagement in the data collection and analytic processes. To do this we need to move the focus from one of intersubjectivity to one of interobjectivity (Latour, 1996) and to examine horizontal movement across cooperating agencies.
