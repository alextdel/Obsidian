# Baxter et al 001 - Qualitative case study methodology: Study design and implementation for novice researchers


1.  Ethical - Confidentiality, Informed Consent, What ethical tensions
2.  Methodological - How, Data Collection, Flexibility, How to provide rich accurate picture
    1.  One of the first things to do is to decide the unit of analysis (the 'case') is to be
        1.  "The case is defined by Miles and Huberman (1994) as, “a phenomenon of some sort occurring in a bounded context. The case is, “in effect, your unit of analysis” (p. 25). Asking yourself the following questions can help to determine what your case is; do I want to “analyze” the individual? Do I want to “analyze” a program? Do I want to “analyze” the process? Do I want to “analyze” the difference between organizations?" pp. 545-546
    2.  Author suggest that ' propositions' can be used to limit the scope of case study and increase the likelihood that the study is completed within a reasonable time. p 551 - Baxter et al point out that Yin uses 'propositions' while Stake uses 'issues'.
    3.  Types of case study
        1.  Different researchers use different terms
            1.  Yin categorizes case studies as explanatory, exploratory, or descriptive. He also differentiates between single, holistic case studies and multiple-case studies.
                
            2.  Stake identifies case studies as intrinsic, instrumental, or collective.
                
3.  Sampling and Selection - Choosing case, how many, + and - of limiting sample to cases
4.  Analysis - Typical Analytical Methods, advantages and disadvantages
    
5.  Validity and Trustworthiness - relate issues of validity and trustworthiness to the philosophical background
6.  Accurate Quote - "paste here" - p XX
