# Ingvarson 001 - Recognising accomplished teachers in Australia: Where have we been? Where are we heading?


1.  State and territory ministers of education committed to supporting quality teacher and school leadership in the Melbourne declaration on educational goals for young Australians in 2008
2.  At this time the focus on teacher quality was consistent with research about what matters most for student learning and enjoyment of schooling.
3.  As part of the reform agenda COAG agreed to the development of a nationally agreed professional standards framework for teachers.
4.  The national standards have 4 career stages; graduate teacher, competent teacher, highly accomplished  teacher and lead teacher.
5.  the COAG teacher-quality reforms recognise the need to build stronger links between progression and evidence of increasing expertise for teachers.
6.  the COAG agreement calls for fundamental reform of salary structures and career pathways
7.  COAG reforms are consistent with research on effective ways of linking salary to performance and tiered pay and career structures which are emerging in the USA and Scotland
8.  Reforms are based on
    *   profession-wide certification, not one off bonus payment schemes.
    *   standards based assessment, conducted by independent professional body
    *   not based on research of remuneration based on value added measures of student achievement on standardised tests - as these are invalid ways of discriminating between teachers
9.  Two methods of evaluating teachers exist
    1.  evaluation aimed at ensuring typical or acceptable or contractual requirements for the teacher
    2.  evaluation aimed at identifying standards for accomplished teachers. The question here is if the teacher has reached a defined standard of expertise
10.  There are many great teacher in Australia but current mechanisms for recognising their expertise are weak.
11.  Current efforts to promote teacher quality call for teacher evaluation systems that identify and reward highly accomplished teachers.
12.  Australia has twice attempted to establish a national professional body: the Australian Teaching Council in the mid-1990s and, in the mid-2000s, a body called Teaching Australia: The Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership. Neither of these bodies carried on as they were designed for complex reasons.
13.  Each was undermined by the fact that the bodies were not perceived to be comprised of experts and genuinely independent, yet embracing all interested parties. Late in 2009,Teaching Australia was replaced with yet another national body, the Australian Institute of Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL), the sub-name of Teaching Australia. This body will be more directly responsible to Commonwealth, state and territory governments (COAG) as the main stakeholders, through the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs (MCEECDYA)
14.  AITSL is the first of these national bodies to have clear support from all governments and employing authorities and specific functions with respect to teacher quality.
    1.  to develop a system for the certification of teacher at three career levels beyond graduation
    2.  responsibility for the accreditation of teacher education programs
15.  Further levels are envisaged for aspiring school leaders and accomplished school principals.
16.  Research indicates that teachers are necessarily specialists in terms of what they can teach well, and with experience they tend to become increasingly specialised. Expertise in teaching is 'domain specific', not generic (Brophy, Hill, Rowan and Ball, Shulman)
    \- generic standards are problematic and of limited use in giving guidance
    \- standards need to be written that are specific and able to be used by assessors and understood by teachers
    \- "Standards need to point clearly to observable features of accomplished knowledge and practice, without specifying how teachers should teach" p. 64
