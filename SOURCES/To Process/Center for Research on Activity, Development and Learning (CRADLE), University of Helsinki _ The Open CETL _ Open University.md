# Center for Research on Activity, Development and Learning (CRADLE), University of Helsinki

**PBPL has engaged with communities who have complementary research and development goals, beyond the Open University and the UK. The work of the Center for Research on Activity, Development and Learning (CRADLE) at the University of Helsinki is one such group, whose contribution to the research and development of practical interventions in the workplace offers a rich point of contact and learning for us**

PBPL has hosted two conferences at The Open University at which University of Helsinki delegates have given keynote presentations.

[![[cbf849dd3ac750c4891bfe59f72c2b44.jpg]]](http://www.open.ac.uk/opencetl/files/opencetl/image/CRADLE_Group.jpg)The most recent was the [Activity Theory and Practice Learning Conference, 2009](http://www8.open.ac.uk/opencetl/practice-based-professional-learning/activities-projects/activity-theory-and-practice-learning-conference-2009) which took place on 1st and 2nd June. The purpose of this event was to hear about how our Finnish colleagues have been drawing on cultural-historical activity theory to research workplace change and to contribute to collaborative development in a range of contexts. Extending over two days, the first day was open to Open University (OU) and external colleagues.

Keynote presentations from Professor Yrjö Engeström and Dr. Hannele Kerosuo from the [Centre for Research in Activity, Development and Learning at the University of Helsinki](http://www.helsinki.fi/cradle/), Dr. Juha Pihlaja, consultant from the Verve Consultancy, Helsinki, Drs. Antti Kauppi, Jussi Onnismaa and Leena Rasanen from the Palmenia Centre of Continuing Education, University of Helsinki were warmly received. During the afternoon, two parallel groups heard presentations from OU practitioners on the implications of Activity Theory for Practice Learning. A final plenary session provided delegates with time for informal discussion and the opportunity to raise issues from the day and hear responses from the presenters.

During day two, Professor Jaakko Virkkunen from the University of Helsinki and Dr. Alison Shreeve from the University of the Arts, London made keynote presentations which were followed by a chaired discussion on the implications of the conference for The Open University, PBPL CETL and future collabroation with conference delegates.
