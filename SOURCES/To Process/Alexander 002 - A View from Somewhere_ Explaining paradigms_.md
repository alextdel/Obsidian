Note - One explanation for the way to consider Qualitative research is to consider there are two epistemologies that exist - those of positivist which concentrates on the controlled and sometimes contrived and isolated (from real life sometimes and from the researcher) study of cases using empirical measures to discover general truths and causal relationships, and constructivism which focuses on interpreting the socially constructed form of truth based on a naturalistic and involved study where the researcher is a participant.
2.  Method Note - none this is a look at the philosophy and reasoning behind Qual research
