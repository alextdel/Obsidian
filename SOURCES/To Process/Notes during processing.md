# Notes during processing


Warren strongly believes that the patterns set for him during the mentoring process that occured in his first year have had a positive beneficial effect on his teaching.Â 
Behaviour management is a cornerstone of how warren sees successful practice being played out in the classroom.

In line with Dreyfus and Dreyfus Warren found that in the second and particularly in the third year he was more of an equal and felt more part of the team. This puts him in the Advanced beginner category.

By the second and third year Warren's posting put him into a situation where he was more experienced within the team than others. This meant his ideas were being asked for.

A contradiction in the way that the development of teacher practice can be seen here. Mentors and leaders should be more experienced and have the insight born of extended and repeated use of teaching skills. In the case of Warren the system in which he worked put him into a position where his limited expertise became the focus for less experienced teachers to look to. This is a contradiction.

This situation led to a trial and error approach to many problems with no clear leader or leadership.

approximately 4 years after leaving pre-service training Warren was involved in advising and training other teachers in remote areas on the use of computers. Again he was put into the position of a leadership role as a mentor and guide without a great deal of experience or support.

This seems to indicate a theme of inappropriate structures and insufficient attention to the progress and support required by teachers. Warren is supporting others in the use of technology in one case and in the other is working as a supposed more-senior teacher in a team. This seems to deny the obvious requirement for a more experienced teacher as part of the team or for specific training that would give teachers the skills required in order to function more effectively.

Warren sees the milestone of when he was looked to for ICT guidance in his third school. He became the de facto network administrator. He was not prepared technically but because he was in the position of being asked to take the leadership role in a small school he rose to the challenge and found out - this was effectively pd.
