# Grunbaum 001 - Identification of ambiguity in the case study research typology: what is a unit of analysis?


1.  Grunbaum sees a need for a more elaborate reconceptualisation of case study as there is ambiguity between the 'case' and the 'unit of analysis'.
2.  Grunbaum points to a low level of consensus among researchers. (p. 78)
3.  Grunbaum links a vague understanding of the understanding of 'unit of analysis' with issues of transferability and authenticity of research using case study.
4.  He see's that there is an 'anything goes' approach to the definition of case study and that researchers perceptions are 'blurred and fuzzy'. (p. 79) He thinks that this extends to case study being anything that is not considered to fit the headings 'experiment', a 'survey' or a 'historical study'.
5.  Grunbaum gives a detailed account for how cases relate to the unit of analysis
6.  Figure 2 on page 89 shows how the central unit of analysis (which is from where the focus of the research rests and the micro analysis will occur) can be embedded or nested in layers of cases where the level of abstraction is higher and the analysis will move from the micro to the macro
