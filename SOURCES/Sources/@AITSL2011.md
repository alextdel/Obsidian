**My brief note:**


**Abstract:**
Work on the National Professional Standards for Teachers (the Standards) commenced under the auspices of the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs (MCEECDYA) in 2009. Significant work was undertaken by the National Standards Sub-group of the Australian Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs Senior Officials Committee (AEEYSOC) during 2009-10. The Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL) assumed responsibility for validating and finalising the Standards in July 2010. The National Professional Standards for Teachers were endorsed by MCEECDYA in December 2010. AITSL appreciates Ministers' commitment to quality teaching and to the National Partnership on Improving Teacher Quality, and looks forward to continuing work with them on these important national reforms.
