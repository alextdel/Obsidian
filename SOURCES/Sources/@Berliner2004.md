**My brief note:**
Expertise in teaching began to be studied based on the methods and findings from cognitive psychology in the 1980s. Findings from education and psychology produced a set of assertions regarding the characteristics of expert teachers. This brought  about the question of the difference between [[Novice Stage]] and expert practitioners. This brought about a field of study regarding the transition from novice to expert. 
This paper notes propositions about teaching expertise and then focusses on one, that is the proposition that there is a need for theories that describe the development from novice to expert status in terms of stage models - see [[Stage Models MOC]].
Berliner looks at:
- [[Dreyfus and Dreyfus 1986 heuristic model]] of teacher development.
- [[Model of Domain Learning]] (MDL) a three-stage model

**Abstract:**
Propositions about the nature of expertise, in general, and expertise in pedagogy, in particular, are discussed. The time needed to develop expertise in teaching and the highly contextual nature of teachers’ knowledge are also discussed. Four theories of teacher development are presented, with an elaboration on the heuristic value of the theory of Dreyfus and Dreyfus (1986). Examples from the pedagogical literature are used to illustrate this theory. The recent research establishing causal relationships between those identified as experts in teaching and their students’ academic achievement is also presented. This research allows those who study expertise in teaching to have a more objective measure for identifying and studying expert pedagogues.
